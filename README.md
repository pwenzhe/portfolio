## Projects (General Assembly)
Four group projects and one individual capstone project was done during the Data Science Immersive course at General Assembly. With the exception of Projects 1 and 2, Streamlit was used to demonstrate the final models.

### Capstone Project: Donor Leads through Networks
 - Created a proof of concept using a social network recommender system that recommends new donor leads to charities
 - Data was obtained by scraping Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) [Charity Portal](https://www.charities.gov.sg/Pages/AdvanceSearch.aspx) to extract charity information and the people associated with each charity, who are then synthetically used as if they are existing donors
 - The social network recommender system uses concepts such as community detection, centrality, and distance to provide a calculated score on recommending donors

### Project 4: Hate Speech Detection
- This project explores creating a data science project with social impact
- Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/hate-speech-and-offensive-language-dataset) containing hate speech, offensive language, and neither was used to build classification models
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models were built and experiemented with GloVe word embeddings then evaluated for F1-score and accuracy
- Tesseract was used for computer vision to detect text in images

### Project 3: Coffee and Tea Text Classifier
- Inspired by online personality quizzes to create a binary classification to determine if a person is more likely to be a tea or coffee drinker using natural language processsing
- Data obtained from scraping sub-Reddits (r/coffee and r/tea) using [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- The final Multinomial Naive Bayes model with Count Vectoriser was chosen after evaluating on accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall

### Project 2: Singapore HDB Resale Price Modelling
- Use of feature engineering to create more generalisable features
- A prediction model using Logistic Regression with Ridge Regularisation was created

### Project 1: Exploring Climate Data in Singapore
- This project focused on exploratory data analysis on Singapore's weather data
- It explored the potential relations between rainfall and the booking of SportSG facilities
