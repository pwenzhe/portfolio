I do see a ton of recs to look at the sidebar vendor list. That list has 261 vendors on it, and it includes places like Jesse's Teahouse, which I frequently see called out here as a grift.

I have no idea how to narrow down the list of vendors to ones that are actually respected.

I got Adagio off that list, then I saw it described as ""fine for beginners"" the other day. Yunaan Sourcing comes up a lot, but I saw the exact same criticism there and also that ""obviously you shouldn't get oolong there"". But I had no idea.

So how do YOU research vendors? How do you vet on the front end that someone is going to send you quality tea?

199vnrw,What should Assam tea taste like?,16,7,,"I mostly drink Chinese black tea from Yunnan. The flavor is often malty, deep, dark berry-like and very smooth. Since I've been inspired by HK milk tea recently (I'm aware they use a mix of Ceylon and a special brewing process), I wanted the richest and maltiest possible tea, to maybe experiment with milk since I've never had milk tea before. So I bought two types of Assam tea. To be fair, I didn't research much about Assam's renowned estates, gradings etc. The gradings are STGFOP1 and SF FTGFOP1.

Even without adding milk, there's not really a discernible taste other than a sharp astringency. To be honest, it tastes exactly like a Twinings tea bag; thin and bitter. The opposite of malty and rich. Brewing for a few minutes in a \~200ml pot or \~120ml gaiwan. A lot of leaves.

Obviously, I can't generalize an entire tea type based on randomly trying only two of them, so did I just choose bad tea? Or does Assam tea generally taste like this and I'm looking the wrong way?",Professional-Fan1372,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/199vnrw/what_should_assam_tea_taste_like/

199ng75,Judging Matcha By Color,13,6,image,"Judging matcha by color! Here's how.

Good matcha = bright green, like spring grass after rain. Think vibrant, almost electric green. This kind of green tells you the leaves were shaded just right and picked young, making it sweet and smooth.

Bad matcha = dull green, like old moss. Brown or yellow tinges are even worse. These colors mean the leaves were old or not shaded, so the matcha will be bitter and kinda bleh~ (vomit)

Think of it like traffic lights:

Bright green = GO! Grab this matcha, it's gonna be delicious.

Dull green = CAUTION. Maybe okay for baking, but not for sipping.

Brown or yellow = STOP! Run away, this matcha needs to go in the bin, not a cup.

Bonus tip: The deeper the green, the fancier the matcha. Think emerald jewels, not pea soup.

Remember, color isn't everything, but it's a great first impression. So next time you're choosing matcha, give it a good glance before you take the plunge.

Online Shopping?

Shopping for matcha online is tough! You can't see it for yourself, unlike in a store. That makes it hard to know if it's the right color.

Even photos are tricky. Phones and cameras can mess up the true color of things. This picture I took? Phone camera, no flash because it made it look yellow. I had to play with the brightness, colors, and light settings on my phone to get it closer to the real thing. Fancy editing software? Nope, just phone tricks. I got it mostly right, but not perfect.

Judging matcha by color? In person, it's a good way to go, but not totally reliable. Videos and pictures? Forget it!

The best way? Samples! Ask sellers for tiny amounts to try before you buy. That way, you can taste and see for yourself if it's the matcha you're looking for.

Happy judging!",ujihatea,https://i.redd.it/cj1pm0w5i6dc1.jpeg
199qwgg,Gyokuro at Gion Tsujiri and Uji Fukujuen,8,2,,"Many moons ago, Gion Tsujiri used to offer this beautiful tea set on their menu. They actually had English instructions but maybe because I tried to act snobbish and ordered with my less than toddler level Japanese so the bad karma reward me with this Japanese instruction leaflet I have no clue how to read and yes they left me alone to brew this Gyokuro which I barely have idea of the perfect brewing.

Anyhow, after struggled with the whole ordeal. I managed to ""wing"" ahem ( read ""brew"") myself a cup of not too bad Gyokuro.


I think I don't have that gene for umami sweetness. I only taste like umami type saltiness. It was a fun experience though.

Next one was at Fukujuen, I think they came with English leaflet, and again you brew your own Gyokuro.

I can't really tell the differences though from these two places. 

BUT

Fukujuen let you eat the tea leaves afterwards. So you dip in ponzu/ yuzu ponzu sauce to eat the precious leaves!

I don't know if they still do it now but it is also a worthy experience for tea enthusiasts.

Also if you happen to visit Kyoto..

199okvo,"Water Comparison on Green tea: Brita Jug water vs Clean, but very hard Swiss tap water. Brita loses",11,27,,"TLDR: Not all hard water seems to profit from a Brita jug. For some, I think it has quite a detrimental effect.

Title is a bit misleading, it's not that hard at 100mg/l calcium.

I heard from multiple sources, that filtering water with a brita jug is a no brainer if you got hard water or any other issues with water.

I just tried it in the context of hard, but clean water and can't recommend the brita jug at all. Interestingly, the taste seems flatter, unpleasantly sweet and just a bit rounder.

\- Water: put to boil. Very drinkable Swiss tap water with \~100mg/l calcium. Two steps to reduce scale: 1. Multiple Scale catchers(looks like steel wool) in the kettle 2. Giving it a short rest, such that the small scale particles flow to the bottom. I throw the bottom 20% of the water away. Looks very milky, so seems a lot of minerals are in there.

\- Tea: Taiwanese Bi Luo chun. Very light, floral tea with an Oolong note, that was particularly muted by the Brita.

Especially during later brews, the Brita tea lacked deeper notes, complexity and florality. The tap water did have a bit of an aggressive mineral note, but it was overall better.

Disclaimer: This was according to my expectations, hence there might be bias involved. A local tea seller made similar experiences and told me prior. Also I am very used to drink tea made from this water.

Somebody has experience and thoughts about this scenario?

Maybe I need to do a blind taste...

199xyck,Experience or info on the Senbird TETSUBIN GEN and KIYOSHI Luxury Tetsubin teapots?,1,4,self,"I have been looking a new teapots and am curious about Tetsubin cast iron teapots. On the higher end  teapot listed below, people say it gives the tea a better taste, and am curious if folks have experience with that and that particular teapot.

I am concerned about anything made in china, and particularly concerned with enamel/ceramic coating because when put on cookingware using new nanotechnology methods for adhesion, titanium nanopartiles have been shown by peer-reviewed journal articles to leach into our food. It could be a minor issue if the qualities are low enough, but so far I see far too little research into its safety for comfort.

(On a side note, I think ceramic pottery (cups, plates) are fine. That probably goes for most pure ceramic tea pots too.)

Even though this [KIYOSHI Luxury](https://www.amazon.com/stores/KIYOSHILuxury/page/171C7543-ED02-46E6-9404-49C5CA92B681?ref_=ast_bln)[ Tetsubin](https://www.amazon.com/KIYOSHI-Luxury-Japanese-Stovetop-Interior/dp/B08HSDHBM4/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=RWrG0&content-id=amzn1.sym.35cab78c-35e3-4fc1-aab0-27eaa6c86063%3Aamzn1.symc.e5c80209-769f-4ade-a325-2eaec14b8e0e&pf_rd_p=35cab78c-35e3-4fc1-aab0-27eaa6c86063&pf_rd_r=XY7D59S7JVQ1BGMPTZGK&pd_rd_wg=098S1&pd_rd_r=e8f8dc28-1655-4749-8313-887a89042f71&ref_=pd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_atf_m&th=1) tea pot is suppose to be handmade, I have my doubts due to the price, and the lack of info about the brand off of Amazon.

On the opposite end of the spectrum [Senbird TETSUBIN GEN teapot](https://senbirdtea.com/products/tetsubin-cast-iron-kettle-teapot-gen) is $250. They do have a website on which they detail some of their production process and they claim to use methods 900 years old. I still can't be 100% certain but given their price point and website, I would trust their enamel interior is made without nanotech. However, I find very little in terms of outside reviews on this $250 product, which is concerning since I would hope it would be good enough quality to last a lifetime and be passed down as a heirloom. The 2 reviews on the Senbird website both mention that the teapot does make the tea taste superior due to the minerals released into the tea.",WaterCello,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/199xyck/experience_or_info_on_the_senbird_tetsubin_gen/

I am a barista with a deep well of coffee knowledge, but I’m admittedly a novice in the world of tea. The owner of my small cafe requested I reevaluate our tea offerings. 

I was hoping this community would be able to share their opinions on what specific teas (varietals and brands) you’d like to see on a menu at a non-tea-focused cafe.

1992qmz,The Tablewine of the South: A Love Letter to Iced Tea,14,4,,"Hey everyone!

I had a shower thought today that made me smile. You know how in many cultures, table wine is a staple at meals, something that’s always there, enjoyed without much fanfare but deeply appreciated? Well, I realized that in the South, iced tea holds a similar place of honor.

It’s fascinating how iced tea is so deeply ingrained in Southern culture. It’s more than just a beverage; it’s a symbol of hospitality, comfort, and home. Whether you’re at a family gathering, a local diner, or even a fancy restaurant, iced tea is always there, quietly making every meal a little bit better.

I love how it varies from place to place too. Some like it sweet, some prefer it unsweetened, and then there are those adventurous souls who add a twist of lemon or mint. It’s like each glass tells a story of the person who made it.

In a way, iced tea is the unsung hero of Southern cuisine. It doesn’t ask for attention, yet it’s an essential part of the experience. It’s the perfect companion to everything from barbecue to a simple sandwich.

Just wanted to share this thought with you all. Next time you sip on a glass of iced tea, maybe think about the role it plays in our culture. Cheers to the tablewine of the South!

What are your thoughts? Do you have a special way you like your iced tea?

Speaking of iced tea preferences, my own journey with this Southern staple has evolved over the years. I started with the classic Lipton iced tea, which was my go-to for a long time. It was familiar and comforting, like an old friend. But then, I discovered Community iced tea. It was a game-changer for me, offering a richer flavor that really elevated my tea experience. However, the real revelation came when I tried Luzianne. There’s something about its smooth, robust flavor that just hits the spot perfectly. It’s like it was tailor-made for those hot Southern days. Luzianne has now become my absolute favorite, a testament to the varied and delightful world of iced tea.",xcrossxoutx,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1992qmz/the_tablewine_of_the_south_a_love_letter_to_iced/

198pxm0,Why is tea so miraculous? I don't understand,46,40,,"I just don't get it, I like to write a lot wheter it be beautiful prose, poetry or novel chapters and when I do so without tea, I procrastinate a lot, it feels like a chore and I have to force myself to write line after line.

But drink a cup or two of green tea or matcha tea and everything flows, poetry flows like a stream with no limit, the typing feels natural, words follow each other making lines, lines turn into paragraphs and before I know I'm already in the flow state with enough fuel in the tank to complete the work and be in awe at its quality when I finish.

I'm not unfamiliar with this type of thing, I used to do Lsd and it was very similar but of course much more powerful in terms of creative potential

It's weird but whenever I ingest any kind of substance (I haven't done lsd in a year btw), so now tea but whenever I do, its like my brain goes from this messed up state of inability of concentrating on literally anything to being able to connect with itself and build a potent and beautiful structure that can generate beautiful and suprising creative ideas that are otherwise impossible sober.

I also want to say that I am the type of person who always tries to be in the flow state, I like to listen to music deeply which I do while I drink the tea, I listen to music and write and tea helps like go deeper into it, not comparable to lsd where you Are inside the music but its still impressive.

Is there any reason for this?

An example is its been barely like 10 minutes since I began this post and I faced no obstacle trying to write it and I didn't feel a sense of time while writing it.

Can meditation help increase this state or atleast reduce the need for too much tea?

also forgot to mention, I kinda don't feel good or more like my mood goes bad easily normally but with tea, there is atleast a slight uplift in the mood which helps me actually work.

Thanks for reading.

199187w,Stepping up from Yorkshire Red,3,10,,"Alright. I'm ready for the hate about being a bag drinker, but I grew up with a British nan who would always make us tea.  Extra milk and sugar for the kids.  Started my love for tea, I never knew what brand she used but when I got older and tasted Yorkshire Red (the British bags, not the wrapped American ones), I knew I had found it.  Brought me right back to her house and the memories came flooding back.

Quick FYI for those that don't know: American Yorkshire bags are smaller and have strings, British ones are bigger and have no string.  Apparently through market research they found the American market preferred weaker teas so they made bags to accommodate.   If you want British bags in the US, this is their [official partner](https://www.britishbrands.com/yorkshire-tea-s/1921.htm).

I'm a loyal drinker of Yorkshire Red (British bags), but I'm looking for a loose leaf step up.  Every assam I've tried in Loose Leaf just hasn't tasted nearly as good as a bag of Yorkshire.  I'm absolutely certain this is due to my own ignorance when it comes to tea.

If anyone here has a recommendation of a loose leaf tea that would approximate a a higher quality version of Yorkshire Red tea, I would love to hear the recommendation.

198u583,1392 Huang Zhi Xiang Fenghuang Dancong Review,9,7,,"This is a factory/gift tea quality Yellow Gardenia Fragrance oolong from a local Chinese tea store. This tea has been imported under the obscure 1392 brand. Oolongs have been the tea type that has given me issues, I've struggled with brewing them and I've found it hard to find one that appeals to me. This is the first one that has, having tasted it at the tea house yesterday I picked up 30g to trial and review.

The material looked good to my untrained eye, nice sweet and baked smell, little breakage and seemingly well rolled. 7g@140ml for 1:20 ratio, brewed at 100 degrees unless mentioned

I did 5 flash steeps before a 5, 10, 30 and 60 second brew for a total of 9 steeps. Very immediate and forward sweetness throughout the whole session, a gentle tannic taste with slight vegetal and baked notes as the liquor cools. A slightly deeper charcoal taste is brought forward in later steeps.

The aroma is amazing, when smelling close to the liquor, the smell is of baked dough and nuts, little sweetness. As you smell from a bit further away, the floral notes are amazing and so in your face it's like sniffing a bouquet. The empty cup smells incredibly sweet like cookies.

The qi is minimal, slightly focusing but otherwise nothing going on. After the first two steeps there is a  cooling and minty taste on the tongue that grows stronger in subsequent steeps. The bitterness drops off after the 4th steep and there's plenty of sweetness combined with the nearly minty menthol effect. The tea will keep up for maybe 12-15 steeps if you're willing to extend your steeping times.

Overall, very good. I can imagine enjoying this when I (rarely) want an oolong, or as an easy offer to people who don't drink tea. I would bring it up to 9 or so grams (1:15) to tease out more longer lasting bitterness as it dropped off a bit too quick for me. Most importantly I can see why people like oolongs now. It's important to widen my horizons to make sure I'm not missing stuff I'll enjoy, there's a long way to go but this was a nice stop.",zhongcha,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/198u583

198pmis,first time making/tasting pu-erh and it tastes very very subtle :/,3,6,,"so i got a raw pu-erh sampler from TeaVivre (ik, probably not the best place to buy from but whatever) and i first tried their instructions for brewing. i did a quick wash, then did about 3-5g in an infuser and brewed in a cup for about 3 minutes. the flavor was incredibly subtle and almost not noticeable - i then brewed for longer and it became very bitter (prob the tannins cuz i steeped too long), but still without much flavor.

next i tried gong-fu style in a teapot (i don't have a gaiwan yet sorry lol) using directions from yunnan sourcing. i did a quick wash, then steeped for about 20 seconds. the flavor was a bit more noticeable - earthy, a bit woody, with a lil bit of funk in there - but it was still incredibly subtle. i did multiple steeps with different steep times and they all were about the same in presence of flavor. also, all of these steeps were done with boiling/near-boiling water. 

i thought pu-erh was one of the most pronounced and strong-bodied types of teas, so i'm wondering if my expectations were too high and it's actually more subtle. or is it just shitty taobao-esque tea i got? also, looking at how i made the tea, is there anything i could be doing different? the type of tea was a fengqing ancient tree spring chun jian raw pu-erh from 2012. thanks people :)",DoctorDerpPHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/198pmis/first_time_makingtasting_puerh_and_it_tastes_very/

I had high hopes for this tea and I dont mean to offend anyone, but it was literally disgusting. It was sweet dont get me wrong. I tasted lot of fruits and such. But most of what I tasted was just straight tobacco. It threw me so off guard because the dry leaves smelled so great, which made me more excited. I literally gagged when I smelled the wet leaves. I had no idea it was gonna taste like that. The taste is still in my mouth as we speak. Again, I mean no harm to anyone who loves this tea. Im just sharing my experience. I will probably give it another try in the future. And one last thing. I would love to maybe know what other popular teas may have this same tobacco flavor so I can avoid?

198kbjn,The Qinling Mountain Tea Series - Part 5: About Mountain Tea,0,0,self,"In the ""Records of the Eastern Studio东斋纪事"" by Fan Zhen范镇 during the Song Dynasty宋, he expressed, ""The tea produced in the area around Mount Meng in the elegant province of Shu is the finest. The tea there grows the latest, usually emerging between spring and summer. Often, the area is shrouded in mist and clouds, as if divine entities were protecting it."" 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/68kp7v2vlwcc1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=7048f0cc425c0ccbc156a98a81fd8cc1ea7e519b

Since the Song Dynasty (960 to 1279), the Chinese know that high mountains produce excellent tea. This has become a widely circulated saying among tea enthusiasts in China: ""Good tea comes from high mountains and clouds."" In Taiwan, oolong tea is judged primarily based on the altitude of the growing region, which is the most crucial indicator of a tea's quality.

## Why Mountain Tea Is Better?

The differences between plain and mountainous regions in tea production are primarily related to climate, altitude, soil, and water quality.

**Temperature:** As altitude increases, temperatures generally decrease. The relatively lower temperatures contribute to tea plants' slow growth, extending tea leaves' growth cycle. This allows the tea plants to absorb nutrients from the soil more effectively, resulting in a more prosperous chemical composition. The lower temperature also aids in accumulating amino acids and aromatic substances in tea leaves.

**Sunlight Exposure:** In higher altitude areas, the proximity to the ground results in more prolonged exposure to sunlight and more intense solar radiation. This favors the process of photosynthesis, promoting the formation of chlorophyll in tea plants. This, in turn, enhances the color of tea leaves and increases the amino acid content, making the tea leaves fresher and more tender.

**Atmospheric Pressure:** The relatively lower atmospheric pressure in high-altitude regions assists in generating and preserving volatile substances in tea leaves. These substances include the aromatic components of tea leaves, contributing to the enhanced fragrance typically found in tea from high-altitude areas.

**Soil Quality:** High-altitude regions generally have more fertile soil with higher mineral and nutrient content. This is highly beneficial for the growth of tea plants and nutrient absorption, contributing to the rich taste and unique flavor of the resulting tea leaves.

**Temperature Variation:** Large temperature variations between day and night in high-altitude regions contribute to the accumulation of amino acids in tea leaves, enhancing the freshness and flavor of the tea.

**Climate Conditions:** Ideal climate conditions for tea plant growth typically include warm and humid conditions with distinct seasons. Due to their higher altitude, moderate temperatures, and significant day-night temperature differences, mountainous areas provide favorable conditions for tea plant growth. In contrast, the lower altitude and higher temperatures in plain regions may not be as conducive to the growth of certain high-mountain teas.

**Altitude:** Most premium tea is grown at relatively high altitudes because of the favorable temperature and fresh air in these areas, which contribute to the growth and development of tea plants. Plains may need to be more suitable for cultivating certain high-mountain teas due to their lower altitude and relatively higher temperatures.

**Soil Texture:** Tea plants have specific soil requirements, usually favoring loose, well-aerated, and organically rich acidic soils. Mountainous soils typically better suit the growth of tea plants, while soils in plain regions may be more diverse and only sometimes meet the requirements for tea plant cultivation.

**Water Quality:** The quality of water also influences tea quality. Streams in mountainous areas tend to be more explicit, providing a purer water source, while human activities and pollution may affect water sources in plain regions.

In summary, when considered together, these factors make mountainous regions more suitable for tea plant growth, while plain areas are relatively less favorable. However, there are exceptions in some plains that are conducive to tea cultivation, usually depending on specific geographical and climatic conditions. The following are some notable plains in China where tea is successfully cultivated:

1. **Nanjing Plain, Jiangsu Province:** The Nanjing Plain is one of China's major tea-producing regions, renowned for premium teas like Biluochun. The region's humid climate and suitable soil conditions contribute to the production of green tea.
2. **Yangzhou Plain, Jiangsu Province:** The Yangzhou Plain is another important tea-producing area known for Jasmine tea and Taiping Houkui.
3. **Hangzhou Plain, Zhejiang Province:** The Hangzhou Plain is a central production area for Longjing tea, considered one of the birthplaces of Chinese green tea. West Lake Longjing tea is a famous variety from this region.

These plain regions succeed in growing tea due to their generally humid climate, suitable soil, and unique conditions that impart distinct flavors and qualities to the tea leaves. Green tea is the predominant type in these areas, and the processing techniques exhibit unique characteristics.

197yrys,The Qinling Mountain Tea Series - Part 3: Tea Cultivation History in China,5,0,," 

Tea plants existed approximately 70 to 80 million years ago, but the discovery and utilization of tea occurred only around four to five thousand years ago. Historical records of tea date back over two thousand years, with evidence suggesting the presence of the word ""槚"" in the earliest Chinese dictionary, ""Er Ya尔雅,"" around 200 BCE. This term was used to refer to the bitter tea plant (""荼,"" an ancient character for ""tea""). By around 350 CE, during the Eastern Jin Dynasty东晋, tea was extensively discussed by Chang Qiu 常璩in the ""Huayang Guo Zhi华阳国志,"" mentioning its contribution as a tribute during King Wu of Zhou's expedition against King Zhou of Shang around 1066 BCE. This indicates that tea from the region of Ba Shu (巴蜀, modern-day Sichuan四川) was offered as a tribute over 3,000 years ago. Therefore, it can be inferred that the cultivation and production of tea existed in China at least 3,000 years ago.

## The Origin of Tea Trees in Southwestern China

Large ancient tea trees were discovered abundantly in China, particularly in Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Hubei. Historical documents, such as ""Wu Pu Ben Cao吴普·本草"" from the Three Kingdoms三国 period, mention large tea trees. Recent surveys have found sizeable wild tea trees in nearly two hundred locations across ten provinces in China, some covering thousands of acres. Notably, in 1961, a 32.12-meter tall wild tea tree was discovered in the dense forest of Bada Daheshan in Menghai County, Yunnan, estimated to be 1,700 years old. Scientifically, the consensus is that the original habitat of tea trees is in the southwest of China, with Yunnan's Xishuangbanna西双版纳 region considered a probable center of origin.

## Exploring the Legend of Shennong神农 Tasting Hundred Herbs尝百草: The Discovery and Utilization of Tea

In the Warring States period, the book 'Shennong Bencao神农百草' recorded the legend of 'Shennong tasting a hundred herbs, encountering seventy-two poisons, and finding relief in tea神农尝百草，日遇七十二毒，得荼而解之.' Folklore tells of a figure named Shennong, who, some 5000 years ago, was an early innovator in agriculture and medicine. Seeking remedies for ailments, Shennong tirelessly explored a multitude of herbs. One day, he encountered seventy-two poisonous plants, and the accumulated toxins left him numbness, burning sensations, and loss of self-control. Seeking respite, he rested under a tree as a cool breeze brought a fragrant and sweet leaf into Shennong's mouth. Revitalized, he chewed on the tender leaves of the tree beneath which he rested, and the toxins dissipated, leaving him comfortable and at ease. He recognized these leaves as a potent remedy and named them 'cha茶' (tea). Another widely circulated legend suggests that Shennong possessed a transparent stomach, enabling him to observe the effects of ingested foods and medicines. One day, he consumed a white-flowered leaf, experiencing a transformation where bitterness turned to sweetness. The toxic substances in his stomach were thoroughly purged by the juice of this leaf, seemingly undergoing a thorough 'inspection.' Consequently, he named this tree 'cha茶.' When afflicted by poisoning in his herbal explorations, Shennong would consume the tea leaves he carried, promptly neutralizing the toxicity. Shennong introduced this tea remedy to the people, rescuing them repeatedly from plague and calamity. The legend of Shennong tasting a hundred herbs is perhaps our ancestors' earliest account of tea consumption.

Tea sage茶圣 Lu Yu陆羽 in the Tang唐 dynasty likely referenced this historical narrative in his work, 'The Classic of Tea茶经,' stating, 'The consumption of tea began with Shennong茶之为饮，发乎神农氏.' Lu Yu also believed that tea drinking was known during the time of Duke Zhou in Lu during the Spring and Autumn periods. Notable figures such as Yan Ying of Qi in the Spring and Autumn era, Yang Xiong and Sima Xiangru of the Han Dynasty, Wei Yao of Wu in the Three Kingdoms period, Liu Kun, Zhang Zai, Lu Na, Xie An, and Zuo Si of the Jin dynasty, all shared a fondness for tea. The practice increased, becoming a cultural norm. Lu Yu noted that tea consumption had become widespread by the Tang dynasty, with households in both the east and west—Xi'an, Luoyang, and regions in Hubei and Sichuan—all-embracing tea. From the legend of Shennong tasting a hundred herbs to establishing tea-drinking customs, this marks the historical progression from medicinal use to beverage enjoyment.

## Valuable Historical Artifacts and Relics of Tea

The historical artifacts and relics unearthed from the over 2,100-year-old Western Han tomb in Mawangdui, Changsha, are abundant. Among them are bamboo slips with writings, silk books, and silk paintings. One of the notable findings is a silk painting depicting a woman offering tea, providing a realistic portrayal of tea consumption by the Han Dynasty emperors and nobility. The burial inventory includes a document mentioning a ""wooden ancient moon chest,"" and based on research, ""wooden big moon"" is considered an alternative character for Jia, meaning bitter tea (茶). This marks the earliest discovery of tea-related items buried with the deceased.

In the underground palace of Famen Temple Pagoda in Fufeng County, Shaanxi, numerous Tang Dynasty relics have been preserved for over 1,100 years. These rare treasures include gold and silver tea utensils, glass bowls, and secret-colored porcelain tea sets. The collection of gold and silver tea items consists of a silver cage for roasting tea, a tortoise-shaped box for storing tea, a tea mill for grinding tea leaves, a tea strainer, a salt table, a silver altar, a silver teaspoon, a tea whisk, a silver stove for boiling tea, and a silver fire container for holding charcoal. This assortment represents China's most complete set of Tang Dynasty imperial tea utensils.

Mount Meng in Mingshan County, Sichuan, has a rich history as an ancient tea-producing region, yielding various famous teas since the Tang Dynasty. Many historical relics have been preserved in the area, including the ""Imperial Tea Garden."" According to tradition, the Imperial Tea Garden, located on the mountainside of Shangqing Side Shan'ao, was where Wu Lizhen, a resident during the Ganlu period of the Western Han Dynasty (53–50 BC), planted seven tea plants. Covering an area of 12 square meters, the Imperial Tea Garden is surrounded by stone railings, with a locked gate, two stone steles on the left recounting the origin of the fairy tea and the achievements of Master Ganlu (the steles are now destroyed). The stone fence is well-preserved, and a new couplet is engraved on the stone gate: ""In the Yangtze River's water and on the top of Mount Meng, tea is abundant.""

Additionally, halfway up Mount Meng, there is the ""Zhiju Temple,"" founded by the Daoist Wu Lizhen during the Han Dynasty. It was rebuilt during the Song Dynasty and restored during the Ming Wanli era. From the Tang Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty, tribute tea was produced here annually, making it one of China's early tribute tea institutions.

The author of the first tea book of the Tang Dynasty, ""The Classic of Tea,"" was Lu Yu, born in Jingling, Hubei. Today, Wudang Mountain in Tianmen County still preserves historically significant sites related to Lu Yu, such as Literary Spring, Lu Zi Well, Lu Zi Spring, Lu Yu Pavilion, and Lu Gong Ci. In his later years, Lu Yu lived in the Miao Xi Temple on Zhu Shan in Huzhou, Zhejiang. The Zhu Shan site still exists today. Lu Yu investigated the tea-producing regions of Changxing in Zhejiang and Yixing in Jiangsu during the Tang Dynasty. Some remnants of tribute tea institutions, such as Jinsha Spring and Guzhu Mountain, can still be found.

The Buddhist sacred sites of Mount Tiantai and Jingshan Temple in Zhejiang during the Tang and Song Dynasties were places where tea cultivation, processing, and the Buddhist tea ceremony were nurtured. During the Tang Dynasty, the Japanese monk Saicho studied Buddhism and the tea ceremony at Mount Tiantai and took tea seeds back to Japan, contributing to the spread of tea in Japan. The inscription on a stone tablet at Mount Tiantai records this historical contribution. Jingshan Temple has maintained the stele inscribed by Emperor Xiaozong of the Southern Song Dynasty, stating, ""Jingshan Xingsheng Wanshou Chan Temple.""

Furthermore, during the Song Dynasty, the ""Imperial Tea Garden"" in Beiyuan, Jian'an (now Jianou), Fujian, and the ""Imperial Tea Garden"" in Wuyishan, Chongan County, both known for producing tribute tea during the Qing Dynasty, as well as the ""Eighteen Imperial Teas"" in front of the Hugong Temple at the foot of Shifeng Mountain in Longjing Village, Hangzhou, visited by Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty, have all survived the ages and are available for contemporary tea enthusiasts to study and appreciate.

## The Evolution and Formation of the Character 'Tea茶'

In ancient historical records, tea was referred to by various names such as 'Tu,' 'Chuang,' 'Cha,' 'She,' 'Xuan,' 'Ming,' 'Jia,' 'Gua Lu,' 荼、荈、诧、蔎、选、茗、槚、瓜芦and more. The earliest Chinese dictionary, 'Er Ya尔雅,' dating back to the Qin and Han dynasties around the 2nd century BCE, mentions, 'Jia, bitter tu (tea).' During the Eastern Jin dynasty, Guo Pu explained in his commentary on 'Er Ya' that tea picked early is called 'Tu,' when picked later, it is called 'Ming.' The character '茶' (tea) first appeared in Emperor Xuanzong's 'Kaiyuan Wenzizi Yin Yi' during the Tang dynasty. In the mid-Tang dynasty, Lu Yu, in his 'Classic of Tea' (Chajing), mentioned the names of tea as 'Cha,' 'Jia,' 'She,' and 'Ming,' officially choosing to use '茶' (tea) and eliminating one stroke from the character '荼' (tu). As for the pronunciation of '荼,' there are two systems: in regions like Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and North China, it is pronounced as 'chai' or 'cha,' while in Fujian, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Shantou, it is pronounced as 'ta' and 'te.' These pronunciation systems were carried overseas, resulting in two pronunciation systems internationally.

In European and American countries, it is written as 'tea' or 'the,' while in Russia, Japan, and other Asian countries, it is mainly spelled according to the pronunciation of the Chinese character '茶,' such as in Russian and Japanese. The word 'tea' pronunciation reflects its origin in China and its global dissemination.",orientaleaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/197yrys/the_qinling_mountain_tea_series_part_3_tea/

## The Qinling Mountain Tea Series - Part 2: The History of Chinese Tea and Tea Consumption Worldwide.

The initiation of the Maritime Silk Road appears to have begun in the Han Dynasty (202 BC – 9 AD, 25–220 AD), developed during the Tang Dynasty(618–907 AD), and reached its zenith in the Ming(1368 – 1644 AD) and Qing Dynasties(1644 – 1912AD). The Silk Road's prosperity is intricately linked to the opening and extension of domestic and foreign sea routes and the enduring significance of silk as a significant Chinese export.

https://preview.redd.it/k126le7kqrcc1.jpg?width=901&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cf6f34f78733407bdb18c1ec9941f9bcba1577d

 

From the mid-16th century to the mid-17th century, there was a transformation in the pattern of Sino-foreign commerce. The progress of European maritime exploration and coastal colonial expansion was completed, incorporating the coastal regions of Africa, the Americas, and the Far East into a global trade network dominated by Europeans. The European pursuit of commerce in the Far East and international colonial activities significantly propelled East-West trade. Only after this global trade network was formed did Chinese products, especially silk, become globally significant commodities. Until the late 17th century, silk remained a primary Chinese export. However, by the early 18th century, it began to emerge as a crucial commodity exported from China to the West, gaining increasing importance. By the mid-19th century, silk exports accounted for 90% of Chinese exports to the West. On the traditional Silk Road, the continuous flow was dominated by Western trading vessels transporting Chinese tea, turning the Silk Road into the Tea Road.

It is a pity that Western people only learned about tea in the 16th century, although tea had been cultivated in China as early as the 2nd century BC. As Sir Geoffrey, a British tea historian, said, ""It is strange that tea, which has been known for 1,500 years, is still not well known in Europe, despite the close contact between China and the West."" It took nearly 200 years for tea to be widely consumed in Europe when it was first introduced to the West.

The earliest Western book to mention tea was published in 1559 by Venetian merchant Giambattista Ramusio. In his Italian travelogue ""Navigation et Viaggi,"" he said he met a Persian merchant named Hazi Mohammed in Central Asia. He introduced him to a plant called ""Chai"" grown in China.

Since then, many Western explorers, sailors, merchants, and Jesuits have brought information about tea to the West. Although their descriptions were sometimes contradictory and speculative, they helped to increase Western understanding of Chinese tea.

Although the Portuguese were pioneers in opening up trade with China, the Dutch first brought tea to Europe as a commodity. Dutch sailors Dirck G Pomp and J.H. van Linschoten, who had worked for Portuguese ships for many years in the Far East, mentioned tea and tea water in their nautical atlases ""Spieghel de Zeevaart"" and ""Itinerario: Voyage often Schipuaet Jan Huyen Van Linschoten near Oost often Portugaels Indien 1579-1592"" after returning to the Netherlands.

The Dutch East India Company was founded in 1594 and completed its first voyage to the Far East the following year. The company's first shipment of tea from Indonesia to Europe arrived in 1606.

Nine years later, the British also began to purchase tea from Europe. In June 1615, Robert Wickham, a merchant at the British East India Company's factory in Hirado, Japan, wrote to his colleague at the company's factory in Macau, asking him to purchase tea in Macau and not to buy a can of the best tea at a high price.

For decades after introducing tea to Europe, it was mainly used as a medicinal herb. The Dutch led the way in drinking tea as a regular beverage and exporting tea as a commodity rather than a medicinal herb.

On January 2, 1637, the Dutch East India Company board of directors instructed the company's governor-general in Batavia: ""Since tea has begun to be consumed by some people, we hope that all ships of the company will carry some tea from China and Japan.""

The large-scale export of Chinese tea to Europe may have begun in 1666 from Fujian. In a letter to the board of directors on January 25, 1667, the Dutch governor-general of India mentioned: ""Last year, we (Dutch) were forced to accept a large amount of tea in Fujian. The quantity was too large for us to handle in the company, so we decided to ship most of it to our homeland (the Netherlands).""

The large amount of tea initially shipped to Europe attracted the attention of the company's directors. On April 6, 1685, the company's board of directors wrote to the company's governor-general: ""Given the large quantity of tea that private individuals are carrying through various channels, we have decided that from now on, the company should take tea seriously as a commodity. We want to order 20,000 pounds of fresh, high-quality tea, packed according to market demand, not stale.""

After the mid-17th century, the habit of drinking tea spread to France, Germany, and the Scandinavian countries. Portugal was also an essential tea-drinking country, and the habit of drinking tea had penetrated the aristocratic circles and even the officialdom. Princess Catherine, who was fond of drinking tea, brought this beneficial habit to the British royal family when she married King Charles II of England.

Since the Dutch had a significant scale of tea consumption and trade in the first half of the 17th century, tea soon became popular in the Netherlands' traditional rival, Britain. The early tea that was shipped to Britain was mainly carried by the crew of the British East India Company, which allowed them to bring back private goods for sale. The London Tea Exchange was officially opened in 1657.

Tea was costly in Europe in the mid-17th century. In 1664, the British East India Company paid 4 pounds 5 shillings for 2 pounds 2 ounces of tea to be presented to Queen Catherine. Two years later, the company produced 56 pounds of 17 shillings for 22 pounds of 12 ounces of tea for the British royal family.

Russia was also one of the earliest European nations to acquire Chinese tea. In 1616, Russian envoy Tyumenets visited the Central Asian Khanate of Adan. The following year, Chinese tea was among the gifts he brought back for the Tsar. In 1658, envoy Perfiliev led a delegation to China, and the gifts the Chinese Emperor presented to the Russian Tsar included three pounds of tea. In 1686, the Nerchinsk Treaty was signed between China and Russia, granting ""free trade for merchants of both nations holding government-issued travel permits."" Controlled by Peter the Great's court, Russian merchant caravans began their three-year journeys to and from China, initially trading in Beijing. From 1693 to 1730, 13 Russian merchant caravans engaged in trade in Beijing, accompanied by approximately 50 so-called ""envoys,"" of which only three were genuinely dispatched by the Russian court. Primarily motivated by commerce, these ""envoys"" laid the groundwork for establishing the Siberian institution in 1697, centrally managing trade with China.

1728, the Chuguchak Treaty was signed, designating Chuguchak on the Sino-Russian border as the trade location. A new trading city was established on the southern side of Chuguchak, about 150 yards away, and referred to as ""China Village"" by the Russians and ""Buying and Selling City"" by Chinese merchants. Chuguchak remained a central hub for Sino-Russian trade for over 130 years until the 1850s.

Despite the growing number of tea consumers among Siberians and some Europeans at the end of the 17th century, tea prices remained high, and the quantity of tea imported to Russia remained limited. Tea ranked second to textiles among Chinese goods exported to Russia, with 7,000 poods (1 pood = 16.38 kg) of brick tea and 6,000 poods of white down tea shipped to Chuguchak in 1750. Until the early 18th century, the quantity of tea imported into Western Europe remained restricted.

The East India Company of England purchased 143 pounds of tea in 1669 and 793 pounds in 1670, both from Bantam. In 1682, the company instructed four ships bound for Xiamen to acquire 1,000 pounds of high-quality tea. In 1687, the ""London"" and ""Worcester"" sailed from Bombay to Xiamen, purchasing 150 pounds of special-grade tea, half in cans and half in other containers. When the ""Princess"" returned to London in 1690 after trading in Xiamen, the board of directors complained, ""In recent years, trade has been poor, and tea, except for the highest quality packed in jars, barrels, or boxes, is equally difficult to sell."" This indicates that tea consumption in England then could have been more substantial.

In 1697, the ships ""Nassau"" and ""Treinbol"" arrived in Xiamen, each purchasing 600 and 500 barrels of tea, respectively. The following year, the boat ""Fleet"" bought 300 barrels of tea in Xiamen. In 1699, the ship ""Mayfield"" purchased 160 dan of high-quality green tea in Guangzhou. At the end of the 17th century, the average annual tea import to England was about 20,000 pounds, only a thousandth of what it would become a century later. From 1690 to 1718, the 14 Chinese sailboats arriving in Batavia each year could only supply enough tea to fill one Dutch tea ship. Until 1715, the Dutch East India Company only ordered 60,000 to 70,000 pounds of tea from the Batavia government, and tea was not yet a primary Chinese product for European purchase. The reasons were twofold: tea was too expensive, surpassing the average citizen's purchasing power, and tea drinking had yet to become a common habit among the general population. In 1666, tea in London was priced at £2 18 per pound, while tea in Batavia was only £2 6 per pound. In 1684, a pound of good tea in Amsterdam fetched 80 guilders (about 24 taels of silver). Prices remained high at the beginning of the 18th century. In 1705, retail prices for tea in Edinburgh were 16 per pound for green tea and 30 per pound for black tea. In 1719, London prices per pound for green tea ranged from 10 to 19, and for Wuyi tea, from 13 to 19, while the average British worker earned only 3 to 4 pence per day.

The exorbitant price of tea was the main impediment to its widespread consumption. Additionally, in the late 17th century, Europeans primarily consumed cocoa, and coffee entered and became popular in Europe slightly earlier than tea.  Between 1720 and 1730, when tea prices sharply declined, tea gradually replaced coffee and became the most common beverage in England. The tea-drinking habit quickly spread across Western Europe in the 1720s, primarily due to the rapidly decreasing prices resulting from intense competition. Though the cost of 5s per pound for tea remained relatively high for lower-income individuals, its intense flavor and ability to be steeped multiple times quickly made it the economical and uniquely flavored choice for these consumers. The expansion of consumption led to increased competition among more merchants and companies entering the tea trade, further lowering tea prices and attracting more consumers, thus marking the beginning of the large-scale importation of Chinese tea into Europe.",orientaleaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/197ype1/the_qinling_mountain_tea_series_part_2_china_tea/

The plant had great sunlight, was regularly watered, and I followed all the other care suggestions that came with the plant when it was ordered. I now have a new plant and am trying to ensure the soil stays moist (I think that was the issue last time) but the leaves are turning ashy black again at the bottom of the plant. Anyone having similar issues or any suggestions for staving off this problem. Despite some of the leaves turning black the plant is budding more at the top. Don't understand what the problem is.

I'm a long time lurker here and long time tea enjoyer in real life, and now I'm here looking for your expert help. 

TLDR at the end.

First a bit background: 

As I was drinking too much tea in the past months and built up quite a resistance to it's refreshing effect I drink caffeine containing tea only till lunchtime and herbal tea (lemongrass, camomile, mint, tulsi,and anything which should help me sleep and wind down) in the evening.  

During the weekend after building and moving furniture I had a beer - one that I like very much - and it's type is gose, and this particular one is described on the can as "" Sour and Salty"" and was so soothing and refreshing, but usually I try to avoid drinking alcohol in the evening, also I don't want to drink alcohol every evening, if I could drink herbal tea instead.

And now my question is there any tea which might come somewhat near the sour and salty tasting notes (preferably one without caffeine, but if it has it I'll just have it in the morning and stick to something else in the evening).  

Alternatively any tea suggestion which is not sweet tasting, as most of the herbal teas I had so far tend to lean that way.

TLDR.: Looking for herbal tea to drink in the evening /before sleep which is not sweet tasting, preferably sour or similar, and regular tea which might be sour and or salty.

Our community is very large and very diverse which results in occasional conflict that requires a moderator's touch, and of course fighting spam and fraudulent activity requires constant vigilance.

We are looking for individuals who have been an active part of the /r/tea community and have a talent for being a calm voice in volatile situations.

196cfub,I roast some Alishan gaoshan at home,81,6,,"My Taiwanese gaoshan oolong sources mostly have unroasted gaoshan and so I usually have a fair bit of the greener stuff at home.

I quite heavily baked some Alishan and here are the photos. The first and last photos are of the original, unroasted tea. You can see the post-roast colouring is not the most even - I'm no tea master - when done on the stove. 

After roasting, a vanillin quality is added to the tea and this oolong gives a presentation of bakehouse breads. The unroasted original is a powerhouse of peppered butter and grillsd veggies. The roasting process does take away some alpine rhythm, but adds in some sweetness. 

Overall a pretty cool exercise in understanding tea, and something i like to do with my gaoshan from time to time. It makes my kitchen smell wonderful too!",M05H1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/196cfub

I reviewed a Dan Cong and Tie Guan Yin in a blog post in some detail, identifying which aspects were most positive (flavor), and which represent limitations (thickness of feel and aftertaste duration, with room for improvement of complexity and intensity).  This works as a summary of how quality levels tend to work out for upper medium and higher quality oolongs in general, and covers a general cost range for different versions from different types of sources.

Related to only hearing about these teas it wouldn't be worth it if someone had closely followed the last round; they're just a little better.

I put 5-6 bags of tazo Awake organic English breakfast in, leave it on the counter (with the bags in) for 30 minutes.

I love the bitterness and I'm guessing high tannins (maybe?) flavor of it. This is enough for 1.5 days, and it's a bit of costly ritual.

I've tried a few random English breakfast loose leaf teas on Amazon, and they taste like Lipton and instead of getting a rich bitter flowery flavor, kind of taste chalky the next day.

Could anyone help to describe what kind of monster I am, and what I should be looking for in a tea if this is how I enjoy it? 

I looked for 1:1 replicas of tazo Awake and couldn't find it. If that exists in loose leaf, I would happily go that route.

Tea in question was a green tea with flavoring, and so, bits of tea leaves are about 2-3 mm in diameter.

Looking into methods it seems CO2 is the 'gold standard' for decaf that preserves as much of the flavour and goodness as well as not leaving residual nasties from heavy chemicals. 

I see the water method mentioned, which seems to be what I'm seeing to be similar to the Swiss water method used a lot in the US for coffee (why not here!?) and results in a decaf but weaker taste etc.

Clipper organic decaf used CO2 comes up but their reviews are pretty damning, largely talking of how weak they are, how even 2-3 bags isn't decent often. 

Taylors of Harrogate seems to mention both water and CO2, with much better cost more.

Both of those are breakfast tea style. It'd be nice to have at least an earl grey style and stronger one if not more. 

Sigh, so much more expensive and you have to worry about how they removed the caffeine if you don't mind just grabbing a supermarket decaf option. 

Here methylene chloride seems to be the method of choice for 99% and how the brand's handle it seems to differ too, many saying conflicting things - very little is left so there's no issue, any left over evaporates when drying, any left over evaporates in the cup (that's the most confusing, wouldn't it just be released into the tea, which we don't want). Many countries don't even allow imports of tea with it in and was shocked we are behind there, much like with the water decaf methods for coffee that are common in the states - here that's craft or specialty coffee!",pickingparts,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/194jnre/decaf_teas_that_uses_the_co2_or_water_method/

You keep your leaves on top and turn the whole thing upside down to infuse. When you turn it back up all the water drains back in to the thermos. Would this be close enough to gonfu style to be an improvement over my current tea bags? If I did this method are the leaves OK to be in there all day and resteeped if more water is added to the thermos?

What other methods do you use for ""office"" tea?  


edit: I was kind of thinking about something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/RUIBOLU-Glass-Tea-Infuser-Bottle/dp/B0CDKWQ4VR/ref=psdc_284507_t2_B07PKK89XQ?th=1).

1. The tin smells heavily of the old tea. The old tea had orange peels in it, and I think that the orange oil had somehow infused into the metal of the tin. Is there anything I can do to get the smell out?

2. In future, with metal tins, should I have the loose leaf tea directly in the tin... touching the metal? Or is the tea supposed to be in a bag... like a plastic bag, in the metal container? I know this is a super basic question but I really know nothing about teas!

193yjf4,Teas with strong taste,2,11,,"Hello tea lovers! I've been trying to get into teas recently and I have some questions for the more experienced ones.

I enjoy hot beverages in general, usually it represents for me calm, rest and home, or a social occasion with my family or friends. And plus it taste damn good and the warmth..!

However, I've never really gotten into tea drinking (and I don't particularly enjoy most of the infusions). A week ago I did my homework , knowing I enjoy strong tastes I bought and tried some of the stronger black teas- smoked tea Lapsang Souchong and spring Darjeeling. I also wanted to try some of the green teas, seems like one of the most known and recognised is chinese Sencha.

The problem I have.. I really do want to enjoy the teas (every time I prepare some it feels so homey and one could even say ceremonial) but it is really difficult for me to taste anything. With the smoked Lapsang I was at least quite intrigued with the strong (and weird) smell and could get close to some taste.

I usually let the tea infused a bit longer than is recommended in instructions with the recommended temperature.

How can I enhance the taste of teas? Wouldn't a sweetener ruin the original taste? Or what teas should I try next?
Or am I just doomed and my taste buds are burned out/used to strong tastes?

PS- to complement the tea related tasting experience- in the past I enjoyed some of the rooibos, will have to try some again.

1938t81,The Qinling Mountain Tea Series - Part 1: What is Tea?,3,0,,"Hello everyone, my name is Cary, and I am a tea enthusiast. I am also the founder of a startup that operates a teahouse in Xi'an, which has been successfully running for the past five years. 

Xi'an is a city famous for its Terracotta Army (兵马俑), and it was the capital of the Tang Dynasty (唐朝) - the most prosperous period in Chinese history. The name of Chinatown (唐人街), where Chinese people gather worldwide, also originates from this dynasty. 

Xi'an is in the foothills of the Qinling Mountains, and Qinling Mountain is the watershed between two of China's most significant rivers - the Yangtze (长江) and the Yellow (黄河). It is home to abundant forests, water, and biological resources, making it an essential area for water conservation and biodiversity protection in China. As a result, it has been recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO for its beautiful natural environment. 

Interestingly, only a few people know that the Qinling Mountains also produce high-quality tea.

I am deeply fond of Qinling and have researched the high-quality tea produced there. In the upcoming articles, I'll share my knowledge and experience about this tea, and I hope it will help you. 

I will begin a series of articles on Qinling Mountain Tea from China. This series will comprise ten chapters (maybe), with 

* Chapter 1 focuses on the basics of tea.
* Chapter 2 on Chinese tea and its global reach
* Chapter 3 on the history of tea cultivation in China
* Chapter 4 on the six main categories of Chinese tea

**Opening**

### Xi'an and Tea

I'm in Xi'an, a city of great significance that has nurtured the cradle of Chinese civilization. From the era of Qin Shihuang, who unified six states, to the illustrious Tang Dynasty, a source of pride for Chinese worldwide, Xi'an has been the capital of these flourishing dynasties. Nestled at the northern foothills of the Qinling Mountains, Xi'an has a rich historical tapestry and marks the starting point of the ancient Silk Road. In times past, the exchange of Chinese tea for spices and silver from other countries across the Eurasian continent laid the foundation for a unique and age-old trade route. 

Five years ago, when I embarked on the journey of the tea business, I was captivated by the various high-quality teas produced in the southern reaches of the Qinling Mountains near Xi'an. Though mysterious and lesser-known in China and globally, these teas boast exceptional quality. So, I am prepared to start a series of blogs delving into the origins of Qinling Mountain tea and the diverse range of teas it produces. These insights will prove enlightening and beneficial to you, dear reader. 

**====================**

**The Qinling Mountain Tea Series - Part 1: What is Tea?**

According to legend, Tea leaves, a rich history dating back thousands of years, originated in China around 2737 B.C. It is said that Emperor Shennong accidentally discovered tea when a tea leaf fell into his boiling water, releasing an enticing aroma. Although this tale lacks concrete evidence, it reflects the enduring history of tea in Chinese culture.

The cultivation and manufacturing of tea have detailed historical records in China, notably found in ""The Divine Farmer's Materia Medica."" This ancient text contains descriptions of tea tree cultivation and tea leaf processing, indicating that the basic techniques were already established in ancient times. Subsequently, tea culture in China continued to evolve, becoming an integral part of traditional Chinese culture.

The primary ingredients of tea are the tender leaves and buds of the tea tree, containing rich components such as tea polyphenols, caffeine, and amino acids. Scientific research has shown that tea polyphenols possess powerful antioxidant properties, positively preventing cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Caffeine, a natural stimulant present in tea, aids in enhancing alertness and mental clarity.

The processing methods for tea vary depending on the type of tea. For instance, green tea retains its vibrant green color through procedures such as fixation and rolling. In contrast, black tea undergoes fermentation, resulting in its characteristic reddish-brown appearance and unique aroma. These processing techniques not only influence the appearance and taste of tea but also impact its chemical composition, thereby determining its quality.

The quality of tea is also influenced by its place of origin. As the birthplace of tea, China boasts a diverse range of tea varieties and production regions, including renowned types like Biluochun and West Lake Longjing. Countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and Japan, with their unique climates and soil conditions, cultivate tea varieties with distinct characteristics.

In conclusion, tea, as an ancient and significant beverage, has a fascinating history, composition, and processing techniques that have been subject to extensive research. With its rich content and diverse expressions, tea culture has not only been passed down for centuries in China. Still, it has also spread and developed globally, becoming a valuable part of human civilization. In the modern era, tea is a delicious beverage and a cultural treasure worthy of in-depth exploration.",orientaleaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1938t81/the_qinling_mountain_tea_series_part_1_what_is_tea/

I started trying out Basilur blends, be it in tea bags or blends. What infuriates me is the instructions for tea preparation that are on packagings. They are very often completely nuts. Either the temp is higher than it should be, there is no water ratio and the sitting time is way too long or too short (I searched on websites for reliable guide how to brew tea and it clashes a lot with the instructions).   


The last straw was today - I received samples of Tipson Matcha Blueberry Tea - since matcha was the first tea I ever learned to brew, I was infuriated that it suggested 100°C and 5 minutes sitting time...

192xtdw,Gykuro not sweet at all but just bitter?,2,16,,"Hi,

I'm new to japanese tea drinking and the first one a tried was a gyokuro (20€ per 100g). I tried a LOT of different combinations of concentration, temp and time, but never got a satisfying result. The tea smells really sweet (licorice?/candy?) but I'm not able to taste it after the brewing. I read the temp shouldn't be higher than 60°C but the label says 2g per 200mL **70**°C and 180s?

So I tried:

2g per 200mL - 70°C for 180s (label instructions, best result: A liiittle bit sweet but quite bitter (or umami?))

5g per 200mL - 50°C for 180s (not sweet and less bitter)

7g per 200mL - 65°C for 150s (very bitter and very unpleasant)

10g per 200mL - 70°C for 30s (boring and a bit bitter)

.....etc.

The water quality is apparently 7,8 dh in my area, which is not too bad, I guess. I used a kyusu (200mL, dark clay), boiled the water in a pot let it cool down and checked the temp with a meat thermometer.

Is gyokuro just not my cup of tea? ...or is the quality bad maybe? the leaves are dark green and there are some long leaves but also a lot of broken up ones. I hope someone can give some advice.

192bnyn,W2T Millstone sampling,14,5,,"Received a couple of balls of this raw puerh as part of W2T's tea club. Described as a blend of maochas from the 2010's, shaped into these balls a month ago - cakes pressed and due for release later this year. 

First cour of steeps reveal a Blang dominant presentation that has a little bit of bite and back of tongue bitterness, but slightly dulled by aging so as to be reasonably approachable. Some storage note (dry) appreciable but it's quite light. 

There is reasonable transformation over many steeps as Millstone has decent longevity, and the pleasant bitterness lasts until steep 6 or so, before the tea truely rounds out and sweetens a little. 

There is a promise of stonefruit towards the end, yet this is not fully realized, and after the tenth steep the leaves empty out rapidly and the tailend is a bit bland. 

Millstone unfortunately is a bit lacking in aroma (nose & mouth) and also has an unremarkable mouthfeel. Huigan is not well developed. 

Overall, Millstone offers a glimpse into both fresh and aged Blang but isn't we developed in either presentation. It doesn't excel in any particular aspect, and represents a fairly middling Blang blend. I wouldn't chose this over factory cabbage or peacock cakes. Not too much to recommend on this first tasting - will try the other ball in a couple of months. 

I was kinda hoping for some better teas through the W2T tea club, but both this and the Christmas cake has been forgettable. Hope things pick up a bit.",M05H1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/192bnyn
19266dh,I spent $2000 on tea this holiday season. I aimed for mid to high shelf items ($0.22-1 per gram) here’s my favorites:,42,50,,"
-Fruit bomb lapsang from W2T
It offers a juicy mouthfeel full of stone fruit and berries when gently gongfu brewed (85 Celsius, 1g per 20ml water with 40-60 sec infusions) with a clean, arousing energy and a bouquet of pumpkin spice, yams, and stone fruit. If you turn up the heat or infusion times you’ll render the tea more like a cup after cup of sweet potato pie in a cup instead. 

-2014 Wu Liang ""Sweet and Thick"" Ripe Pu-erh from Yunnan Sourcing 
This is a great example of a red date and lotus puerh with no bitterness or cook funk and 10+ rich infusions for a great price. This is easy to brew, forgiving if you’re not paying attention, delicious either way and hard to beat the price. 

-Caopingtou Natural Farming ""Ruby Belle"" Oriental Beauty Oolong Tea - Spring 2023 also from Yunnan Sourcing 
This is such a deliciously complex tea, reminds me much more of a Zhen Shan xiao zhong red tea than an oolong, but it is relatively delicate to brew, as are many oriental beauty productions. This tea takes the drinker through multiple cascading 
 waves of flavor and aroma that are all equally represented in an experience that hits everyone with the gnosis that this is one damn good tea. 

-hidden peaks tea’s unblended brick shou is such a balanced shou with an energy that can only be described as zen af 
However it’s $0.70-0.80 per gram sooooo save up for some if you love balanced, enchanting shou tea that blends dates, wood, and lotus all together in an agar wood incense miasma. 


-2016 Menghai ""Golden Fruit"" Ripe Pu-erh also from Yunnan sourcing is kinda amazing because it’s rare that a tea designed to taste and smell fruity actually taste and smell fruity in a balanced manner that has great qualities across the board and isn’t just good for one peak infusion and smells kinda like its namesake. This tea tastes and smells peachy in the most shou puerh way possible without being bad at all. It’s also super cheap and kicks the crap out of most of the “daily drinker” teas I’ve tried from Yunnan sourcing and w2t. 


-Ceylon Silver Needle White from WhatCha 
Is the best white tea I’ve tried this year and also the best silver needle I’ve tried compared to those from Yunnan sourcing and white 2 tea alike.

191m27z,Brew tea like an Englishman,181,65,,"I have the following Reddit post written by a Jerry Kelly (no idea who this is) saved in my notes. I’ve cherished it all these years, and I share it with yall expecting it will provide equal satisfaction.

Brew tea like an Englishmen

On boiling the water

Cold water. Boil it once. Pour immediately into a teapot (If you are making tea for just yourself a mug is acceptable) Left over water in the kettle from last time? Throw that shit away.

On Teapots

This is never cleaned.

•	⁠Your friend thinks it would be a great idea to make cocktails in it? Throw it away.
•	⁠Sick in it? Throw it away
•	⁠Cleaned with anything other than just hot water? Throw it away. Your teapot should have a tea cosy, it is frowned upon if this is not chequered or floral. Bonus points if it matches your tea towels. Regarding the tea cosy: it is entirely acceptable, if not required, that you put it on your head and refer yourself as the Bishop. (Thanks to iamtheparty) As pointed out 'warming the pot' is a common practice whereby a small amount of boiled water is added to the tea prior to the teabags and swirled around. This is to make sure the tea is piping hot. In my opinion this is not strictly necessary but comes under the banner of 'cocking about'.

On Mugs

Teacups and saucers are only used to impress people that you do not want to come to your house. Use a mug. Mugs should be large, clean and most importantly yours * Not your Dad's * Not one that you found at the back of the cupboard at your office kitchen, even if it is the only one that does not smell like off milk. * It must be your own mug. There are many like it but this one is yours. You do not use it at 3am when you feel the need for bathroom tap water. You do not use it to keep your stationary in. You do not permit anyone else to use it. This mug is for tea and tea alone.

On Brands of Tea

Most people have a preference to which tea brand they like. Personally I'm a big fan of Yorkshire tea. PG tips, in my opinion, are of the devil. If someone were to hand me a cup of it, I would drink it. I'm British anything else would be impolite. We will cover etiquette later. Students Red label tea from Sainsbury's is fantastic for its cost. On Tea Leaves Some people have got the time to make loose leaf tea. Well done you. How was art school? I also like loose leaf tea. I drink it when I have nothing better to do or am at a tea shop and have the leisure time to deal with loose leaf. On the whole though, teabags will suffice. Yes they will. Stop it.

On Brewing

One teabag per person and one for the pot. Do not deviate from this method. You do not know better. Again taste varies for the strength of your tea. It is vital, VITAL that you do not over brew the tea. Some of the naturally stronger teas like Yorkshire should not be brewed for long as they will become bitter.

•	⁠Don't go and have a piss.

•	⁠Don't go and chat up that lovely bird in Finance.

•	⁠Don't play Angry Birds.

•	⁠STAY. THE. FUCK. THERE. If you have used a teapot, after a minute use a spoon to stir a few times. Brewing time should be around 4 minutes. Pour a little out into your mug to check the strength. If it is the colour of a dark ale such as Otter then the tea is at a good strength. If you have used a mug stirring regularly is fine. A good indicator of when your tea has reached a good strength is that you can only see the top 1/2 inch of the teabag due to the darkness of your beverage.

On Milk

People vary in their taste for strong tea. While brewing strength is important milk will also lower the strength of your tea. Add it slowly, preferably from a small jug rather than from an ungainly 6 pint milk bottle. You do not want to make a mess, that would be unseemly. Some people say that you must add milk first before adding tea. Some people also believe that pluto isn't a planet. Fuck those people. I have found that it makes very little difference. Much in the same way that if you were dropped into hot liquid you would scream the same amount as if you had boiling liquid poured onto you.

On Sugar

This component is widely debated. Some will take enough sugar to cause diabetes within a two mile radius. The great undecided populous will take somewhere between the most infuriating of measures (just a little bit) and what they call 3 teaspoons, which, due to the ever changing laws of science could mean practically any amount. Those enlightened few will ask for no sugar. This, apart from being a lot easier to measure, is also the most refreshing way to enjoy tea. I have yet to come across anyone who drinks tea with sugar to be anything less than abhorrent. Of course I say all this in jest. Drink tea as you like it. I would encourage you to try it without sugar for one week. If you remain stoically unaffected then you may return to your faux tea with my faux blessing. There is an exception. If someone has just heard some distressing news (like their aunt has just been severely injured by a swan), then sweet tea is the most appropriate prescription. Also, if you are an OAP, you are allowed to drink tea as sweet as you like with complete impunity. (Thanks Anon_is_a_Meme)

On Biscuits

Digestives or hobnobs. Rich teas are a sick joke and are a trap for those of you who dunk biscuits in your tea. If you must have chocolate coated biscuits then choose a dark chocolate variety, these will leave less chocolate on your fingers.

On Etiquette

•	⁠Tea is a social drink, before you make it enquire as to whether anyone else would like one in the vicinity.

•	⁠Drink at your leisure, coffee is for abusing when deadlines approach

•	⁠Biscuits should be served on a side plate

•	⁠If you make any mess while making tea clear up after yourself

•	⁠It is always best to throw any boiled water and any unused tea away after using the kettle and teapot

1921sr7,I've Started Custom Ordering Yan Cha (story),11,2,,"This year and last year I have asked my award winning Yan Cha making friend to do a custom   
roast.  


Since first coming to China I have been looking for a high quality fully roasted yan cha. While I have found plenty of high quality teas they tended to be low to medium roast, very few were high roast. Infact in general very few teas were high roast.

I asked many makers why there was so little high roast as time passes Im able to piece to together the more and more of the picture. High roasts use to be the norm but recently they have fallen out of favor, in part becuase new drinkers dont want to wait for the heat to cool off they prefer to enjoy more quickly. The focus now is more on the aroma as well.  Giving a tea a full roast is also a little risky because you risk over roasting it. Once it is over roasted then you cant go back.

That being said I still wanted high quality yan cha at a fully roast. So after countless trips to Wuyi and even living in the area I decided I was going to need to custom order the tea.

I reached out to Mr. Wu. Mr.Wu was my first contact in Wuyi Shan way back in 2017 and competition wise, the most successful. He has won countless awards, mostly for his rou gui, and done quiet well for himself.

[Mr. Wu being regonized. ](https://preview.redd.it/86hibx6udbbc1.jpg?width=1620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c5ccc06404c36540f8a0a22c6fb38d32449aef88)

I reached out to him because three years prior he had produced a Rou Gui that was at the level I wanted and delicous. I asked him to do it again and he agreed.

A month or so later he told me the tea was ready. He sent me a sample and it was an amazing tea. It was complex and full of flavor. Tasting like warm apple pie. There was one problem...it was a medium roast. I almost considered just accepting the tea the way it was. But no....I wanted a full roast. I asked him to roast it again and he agreed and a week or so later sent me a higher roast. Still not satisfied I asked him to roast it again. He agreed but more hesitantly.

""Are you sure?""""Yes""""This is not what people usually want""""I know. But this is what I want""

He roasted it again, sent me the sample.......And it was amazing! The body was full, thick but smooth with light tannins. Even he said it tasted like red wine, which it did.

The cool thing was that since it was fresh off the charcoal the tea still had heat. When yan cha is made it needs a resting time to lose the heat. with such a new tea i got to taste the affect of a tea having too much heat. The flavors were strong and a bit fuzzy, not very clear. As time went on the flavor profile settled, became more complex and clear and a beautiful aroma emerged.

This year I asked for the same roast but with Shui Xian. Because Shui Xian is a larger leaf it will carry the roast differently. This year he knew exactly what I wanted and roasted it to just the right level on the first try. While still having the heat, the aroma was like stepping into a coffee shop full of freshly roasted beans. Im excited to see how the profile will develope as the tea cools.

I applauded him after tasting the tea.

""Few people would dare make such a roast."" He told me ""It takes great skill to do it this well.""

He was being a little boastful, but I didnt mind. He had earned it.

The tea tray was an inexpensive one from Amazon with a plastic bottom, but I like that for easy cleaning, and no risk of it leaking. Plus I like that the design has a bit of personality.

I ordered 25g samples of several different teas from White2tea. I'm trying to figure out what I like. I was pleasantly surprised to find out they included a sample of their 2020 Natural Redhead as well.

I couldn't decide which one to try first, but I wanted something that would be agreeable to my parents. So I tried the 2023 Big O V3.

I brewed about 5g in a pseudo-gongfu style. A quick 5 second rinse, and an initial steep of about 7 seconds. I'm brewing 250 ml of tea so I can serve some to my parents.

First of all, the colour of the tea is beautiful. Orangey red, like a sunset over the ocean. Gorgeously clear. And my goodness the flavour of Big O v3 is just magnificent. Ripe pu'er warmth with just a touch of pleasant funk, but then the citrus notes really liven it up in a way that isn't overpowering, just complementary. Spectacular.

The second steep, about 15 seconds resulted in even more flavour, and the body of the tea became even richer. A long lingering finish like a warm hug. Perfect for a freezing cold day here in Calgary, Canada.

I'm saving the third steep for my best friend who is coming over soon. But as my first taste of what white2tea has to offer, I'm just thrilled. I can't wait to try the res.",IronCavalry,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/191ysik

After brewing for the second time, the tea soup stayed for 5-10 seconds. This time, the color of the tea soup was more mellow. There was only a faint floral and fruity aroma in the mouth.

I'm new to tea culture, so I wanna ask some questions. 
Currently I have a ""nomad teatsy set"". But I'm looking for something better, what should I get? I like gaiwan, it's very aesthetic. Or should I get yixing teapot? Or maybe some cast iron teapot?
As I can see:
 Gaiwans is around 150ml, and it's enough, but sometimes not enough.
 Yixing teapot is a little bigger, but for me, not so aesthetic, as gaiwan. 
 Cast iron teapot is around 1 liter and it's a lot. And it's more Japanese, I think.
Usually I'm drinking oolong, white, green, red teas. Also I really liked Japanese teas. I don't really like puers, generally cause I have troubles with blood pressure.

I need some help from japanese tea pros...  
I have a few chawan in my closet, that my friend in japan sent to me.

I am trying to get more details of the shape and name of the chawan.  
I stumbled accross the words ""kumidashi"" and ""tsutsu""...as the kumidashi seems to be a smaller cup and the tsutsu chawan is like a taller one, more than a real cup, if I remember correctly?

I would say, these types of chawan are kumidashi chawan, as the shape is not a real cylinder...  
But if you search for kumidashi chawan it says, it´s a short cup used for guests...and they are pretty decent in size.

The bowls are 8cm in height and around 11cm diameter...so it doesn´t look like a ""small"" cup for me.

What do you think???

1917w27,Suggestions for white/herbal teas for a black tea drinker?,3,8,,"My favorite teas are full-bodied black teas with strong flavors; my daily cup has usually been assam or earl gray. I'm trying to cut down on my caffeine intake though, since I'm usually drinking tea all day, and looking for teas with less caffeine to start drinking more of. However, I often find that these teas have a lighter flavor that I find less satisfying, and I'm hoping for some suggestions. It would be nice if it had a similar flavor to black tea, but if it has a strong flavor and a full body, I'm interested in hearing about it.

My absolute favorite herbal tea was Celestial Seasonings Almond Sunset, but they stopped making it :( It was as close to black tea as I've ever gotten with an herbal tea, and delicious. I would be especially interested in any suggestions for similar almond teas. I like floral, malty, stone fruit, berry, vanilla, almond, or honey notes in my tea. (Not necessarily all at once.) I'm open to flavored or unflavored teas. I would especially like suggestions for looseleaf tea flavors/brands since that's my favorite, but teabags are good too.

I've tried the usual herbal lineup: chammomile, mint, tulsi, and lavender, and they're fine but they don't scratch the itch. I've also had chicory and barley tea, which I liked pretty well. 

I like hibiscus and rooibos okay but they're not my favorites. I wouldn't want a tea where they were the main flavor but they're fine as supporting ingredients. 

I don't like honeybush at all, I don't like cinnamon or ginger as a main flavor, and I don't usually care for spice or dessert flavored teas.

190ua5m,To Strain or not to strain: naive question,6,13,,"I confess to ignorance about common tea practices.  I just drink it (gongfu Chinese style).  I started drinking tea a few years ago, bought a small teapot, a pitcher and tiny cups at a street market and tea leaves at various vendors.  Now, back in ""the States"" I largely, well, only buy tea online, sad to say.  I miss the in the teashop tasting and talking ritual.  

Somewhere along the line i acquired a thing to add to the tea wares on hand.  I had never seen it before and have never seen anyone use it.  It's intended use was immediately apparent, and I now use it almost all the time.  But I sometimes wonder when it burst upon the scene (they certainly didn't have this in old China), and sometimes I even am curious as to why we use it, why I never saw it used when i was learning about this insidious addiction.  Were my tea teachers withholding information, unaware of this implement, or just sloppy (or some other more respectful condition) of habit?

My drinking has evolved over time (I graduated from those thimble-sized clay cups to ones that hold an entire teapot's worth of brew and even have a mug that is working it's way into the mix) and I have incorporated this thingie into my routine.  I am speaking of course, about the tea strainer.  Not the infuser.  This is a small, funnel-shaped piece of stainless steel that has a fine mesh at the smaller opening.  It fits nicely into any of my usual tea pitchers and holds back smaller bits of leaf. Does everyone use this?  It clogs up occasionally and acquires discoloration from the tea it processes (which causes me to wonder whether I ought to have one for each of the large category teas (oolong, puer, green and white) as is recommended for the teapots in which I brew this nasty stuff.  

Any thoughts about this both irrelevant and interesting yet deeply naive and tedious inquiry would be thankfully read (by me, at least).

The flavour is that of a typical Assam, rich and deep, malty and a slight sweetness. There’s no astringency in this at all and it’s a beautiful tea to drink. 

Overall I highly recommend if you love Assam teas, and tea in general. It’s a perfect example of an Assam, and to be quite honest wasn’t expecting it to be that good due to it being organic but I have to say that it’s an impressive organic tea for sure.

TLDR: What are good Yixing Clays for Shou Pu'er and Dong Ding Oolong? Effects?

In my years of brewing Gongfu Tea, I have painstakingly avoided Yixing at all cost. I've been a daily user of Jianshui Zitao, Chaozhou clay, and Lizella (a clay from Georgia, US). The risk of buying counterfeit clay or the price tag for vintage yixing was too much. But after more research, I have found some reputable sources for yixing that are within my price range.

Which clays would you recommend for these teas? Extra points if you can recommend a specific teapot shape.

1. **Shou Pu'er:** Full bodied, rich, thick, earthy—something that won't mellow out the shou too much. I brew my shou strong.
2. **Taiwanese Dong Ding Oolong**: Oily thickness, rich, full bodied, aromatic, balanced astringency.

Regular coffee makes my heart race and makes it hard to sleep even when I stop drinking it by noon. (I like having a hot beverage while working through the day anyway.) and even decaf can do that.

I’m diabetic. Over the last few years, I’ve concentrated on my health. Lost over 200 lbs, and I’m off all medication for diabetes, but I need sweeteners for coffee. I switched to equal but my wife heard how that can cause heart problems or strokes so I’m “not allowed “ it anymore.  

I’ve been experimenting with tea. Twinings Blackcurrant Breeze is one I like, and I have been using honey. Has anyone tried coffee mate in it? I made some with oat milk which is ok, but needed sugar. Would love to avoid even the honey.

Also, Oolong is my favorite flavor of them all, has green tea's texture with a nice, non-lawn clippings malt *chef's kiss*; any whole leaf or tea cakes y'all recommend from anywhere?

It's been nearly a year since I been drinking teas instead of soda and juice, I sneaked some here and there ofc but I have a jawline again! (Drink a lot of water too!)

If I wanted coffee, I'd make a builder's brew, which is Assam heavy black tea with milk and sugar — I use Typhoo, which is the British equivalent of Folgers Coffee? Two bags, brewed for six mins, one teaspoon of sugar and enough milk to make it light brown

Yorkshire Gold is a nice step up, PG Tips is an acquired taste imo

If I wanted Sprite, I'd go with Earl Grey, it's divine, I can't even think of a less effette word! Twining's is the one I have but I seriously need to buy a decaffeinated version! 

If I wanted coke, I'd make my own masala chai: two cups of water, four bags of Black tea (I'd use plain Typhoo, it was a 150 pack!), ginger, peppercorns, honey, cardamon, cloves, cinnamon + artificial vanilla to taste — bring to a simmer, stir, slowly add in one cup milk, stir and let it boil for and hour or so, throw in some turmeric too

If you just want flavor, try out Bigelow, Zen, Tea of life, any big box brand that sells tea for obscenely cheap prices will have flavored (very cheaply made though) tea's and roiboos any herbal tea is good too

I am absolutely floored by this tea. It is fragrant and smooth with a very pleasant aftertaste. It is approximately $0.31/gram on their website.

18ze53l,Show Idea: Most Pivotal Food in History,2,13,,"No suspense. It is tea. I sent this in to u/npr 's Throughline in hopes that they would make a show out of it.

Here are three little points that illustrate why the introduction of tea changed history for the better:

* The  Sung dynasty in China saw huge population growth and density as well as  a leap forward in society and culture. Historians are not in agreement  as to what caused this. Tea had just become a common drink after being  domesticated in southern China.
* Starting in the 1300s, Japan  grew economically, politically, and in population. It expanded to take  over neighboring regions and grew more rice than ever due to innovations  in technology. By 1720 it had the largest and densest cities in the  world. Tea had been introduced in monasteries a millennium earlier but  it only became a secular, widespread drink in the 1200s.
* England  started the industrial revolution in the late 1700s. Earlier that  century, gin and beer were the most popular drink and dysentery was a  leading cause of death in London. By 1800, these deaths were basically  gone. Workers needed to pay close attention working machines for hours  and days on end -- gin and beer were no good -- much better to be  drinking tea, which became widespread in the mid-1700s. The coffee/tea  break isn't a generosity for workers, it is to give them a chance to get  hopped up on caffeine and sugar before going back to work.  


Why  is tea so special? The first step to brewing tea is to boil water, for  one, which kills pathogens in otherwise undrinkable water -- this is  vitally important in early cities. Plus it is cheap, shelf-stable,  enjoyable, makes one more alert and less fatigued, and is only mildly  addictive.  
I know you like to look at the gory bits, too, so here are some episodes:

* Opium War: when England got China addicted to opium to trade for tea instead of paying for it.
* Colonization  of Assam: wild tea was found in this English territory, where thousands  died as de facto slaves establishing and working the tea ""gardens.""

You could get more than enough from *The Empire of Tea: The Remarkable History of the Plant that Took Over the World*, by Macfarlane & Macfarlane. If you would like more reading suggestions, I'm glad to put together a list.

I was thinking of buying another testubin, but I just saw the other thread where people pointed out drawbacks of them- including my complaint, which is that the bottom leaves all this rust debris behind on the counter.

What should I look for to buy as a birthday gift to replace the testubin?

Just a teapot with a basket, in the right size? Or is there a term for what I'm looking for?

Here is how it will be used daily:

1. Loose tea placed in basket
2. Hot water poured over
3. Basket removed at end of brewing time
4. Poured into thermos

1. Ceramic (or glass I guess) coated. I've been burned by purchasing an all stainless steel mug and having the taste be off. 
2. Vacuum insulated
3. Preferably 12 oz.
4. Leak proof when closed
5. A loop of some sort to hook a carabiner to. I plan to take this to work and hook it to my bag for easy carry. 
6. (optional) A drinking method that allows me to drink while in a moving vehicle. Occasionally I'll want a sip while driving, but a wide mouth might result in a big mess while driving in city traffic.

After having one full pot to myself I'm usually pretty  satiated, and definitely don't require anymore caffeine after that. Am I wasting it by just throwing out the leaves after the 1st steep?

But I know the bride and her family. They are rich and very generous people who would not buy counterfeit for the guests. I also checked the QR code and it's all legit. The market price for this 250g bag was around 3000 yuan (USD$575)!!! One brew is 5 grams, so it's roughly $11.50/brew.

To be honest, it doesn't taste too much better than the regular Longjing I used to buy. It's slightly sweeter and cleaner. The aroma is stronger. The tea can look almost colorless and it is still full of flavors. I'm very impressed by the appearance of the tea leaves, so beautiful. They are all perfectly ""1 tip 2 leaves"".

18y27lk,Ideas for brewing tea in non permissive environment.,8,48,,"Hi folks,
I'm new to tea. I just bought some tea from Beautiful Taiwan Tea, in indiana. I'm enjoying it so far, clumsily brewing it. I want to be able.to drink it at work.

I work in a place where I can't bring in anything but plastic, possibly a metal thermos, under 24 oz. I may be able to get away with a wire strainer, maybe not. I also can't bring in tea, or any liquid that isn't in a sealed container from a store. So no brewing tea and bringing it along. 


I also won't have access to any way to make hot water other than a microwave.

I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas for how I could brew tea and drink it without tea leaves in my mouth.

My only idea so far is to put my tea in bags and brew that way. But for teas that need to be rinsed, it would be tedious to microwave water, rinse, tools, and microwave more water. I'd probably need a large cup of hot water, and a second smaller cup.

If anyone has any ideas or if they know of any like nested plastic cups or anything I could use to brew without it being a pain in the but, I'd he grateful for you sharing.

18y5bh3,Alternative brewing methods,0,2,,"Hi, I never really liked tea and usually drink coffee. But a few years ago I discovered that it’s because I’ve been brewing it in what I call “the google way” or the English way. as in add a certain amount, steep for 5 minutes and strain. 
Tea brewed that way tasted bland to me, barely any taste no matter what tea I used.

Then I discovered another way, it might seem odd, but it’s delivered the best tea I’ve ever had and made me abandon coffee. The recipe is as follows:

-Boil 1 liter of water (better the quality the better)
-Add 50-55g white sugar depending on taste, stir to combine (while boiling)
- as soon as the sugar dissolves remove from heat, add 11.5g of OP1 cylon black tea of your choice.
-cover and steep for 20-30 minutes, preferably covering the spout and kettle with an insulating cloth
-if it becomes cold, either strain and put back on the stove or put directly on the stove to heat it WITHOUT BOILING AGAIN.

This method IMO gives a balanced cup that actually tastes like something. With barely any bitterness.
Again this might sound odd at first, but I invite you to try it with black tea.

I particularly enjoy teas with a sweet profile something reminiscent of honey, fruity notes, and a touch of vanilla.

Additionally, I’d love some advice on how to enhance the sweetness of my oolong. Should I adjust the brewing temperature or try any specific brewing techniques? Any tips on what I can do to keep my oolong tea consistently sweet would be greatly appreciated. Despite the general understanding that oolong isn’t inherently sweet, I’m on the lookout for teas that offer a naturally sweet profile—something reminiscent of honey, fruity notes, and a touch of vanilla.

My mother-in-law got this for me for a Christmas present while she was antique shopping. She said she got it at an estate sale, and it had this tag with it that claims it is from the 1930s-50s. She wouldn’t tell me how much it cost. I tried to look up this company but couldn’t really find much about them except that they started out by bringing Yixing teapots to the US and then expanded to other wares. 

I feel like it might be a fake based on the color. It has a deeper blue green color than what shows up in the pictures, though the pictures with flash are pretty close to the in person color. 

It has an old antique smell to it. I rinsed it with boiling water x2 and then gently cleaned with baking soda, and it still has an earthy old smell but not as strong. When I was googling about green teapots, someone suggested Wuyi pairs well, so I tried out some rou gui in it, and I think it actually tastes really good. I tried adding boiling water to the pot and then comparing it to plain water from the kettle, and the water from the teapot doesn’t taste off but tastes more mineral-y. 

The seal script says “made by Lü Chun Fang.” I couldn’t find much information about this person, but I don’t really know how to go about looking for that. 

I’d appreciate any help on identifying anything about it. I think I might would still use it either way as long as it’s not dangerous to drink from as it performs pretty well with the tea I tried in it! Thanks.",blue180m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18x93ka

18wv5a1,Does most of the caffeine get extracted in the first steep?,19,12,,"Edit: Thanks to those who responded! My takeaway from the sources provided is that about 60% of the caffeine is extracted after 3 minutes of steeping in boiling water. It differs (of course) for tea types and water temp. But generally, you continue to extract more caffeine on the second and third steep. By the fourth steep, unless you are using very brief steep times, there is unlikely to be much caffeine remaining. This summary is pretty rough, but will be my rule of thumb moving forward. 

I've recently discovered that teas of medium or higher quality can be steeped many times. Some teas, like oolongs, even seem to have improved flavor after multiple steeps. 

But do these second, third, fourth, etc. steeps contain any caffeine? Or is most of the caffeine extracted in the first steep?

Don't get my wrong, I will still do multiple steeps for the flavor alone. But I'm curious if anyone knows whether these subsequent cups of tea still have significant caffeine. ",NoImperfectClouds,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/18wv5a1/does_most_of_the_caffeine_get_extracted_in_the/

18wz5hz,Tea infusion methods,0,4,,"Hi all, I’m a hobbyist mead maker looking to improve the tea flavor in my green tea meads. Typically, what I do is brew 10 teabags/gal of my base before adding any honey or yeast, and then after fermentation I steep another 10 tea bags in the mead before bottling. This usually works great for a product that will be drunk within a couple months however I have a jasmine green tea mead which is approaching a year in age, and although it’s a wonderfully tasting, slightly sweet mead, the tea flavor is almost completely gone. I have a couple ideas for how to improve this flavor:

The first is concentrated flavor addition via tincture. I’ve used tinctures before for adding spices and other such flavors, usually placing ingredients in a jar of everclear for several weeks and testing how much to add for enough flavor (for mulling spices it was just 30 drops per bottle). However, I’m not sure how best to make a green tea tincture because I’m not exactly sure what compounds in the tea are more soluble in alcohol as opposed to water. If I were to use just water, I imagine the best plan would be cold brewing tea, but could I then concentrate this by boiling off the water? Or would that affect the flavor?

The other idea I came up with is leaving a bag (or bags) of tea in the mead long term. But then my worry is will that be a problem if I’m aging a bottle for several months?",Fresh-Fruit-Salad,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/18wz5hz/tea_infusion_methods/

I need the caffeine (thus the coffee), but throughout the day I need a more relaxing tea. After lunch I will probably drink a green tea to get me through the day.

18vyrch,"Yin Zhen, overhyped or an acquired taste?",3,12,,"I've seen this discussion come up before with regard to premium whites. While Yin Zhens are a more expensive (e.g. premium) grade, a lot of people seem to prefer Bai Mudans or Shou Meis, often citing the fuller body. What do you think?

**Personal experience.** I recently found the motivation to start seriously delving into premium chinese teas, having previously stuck with mostly japanese teas. Whites are not something I've explored much, other than lower grades 10+ years ago and an aged Shou Mei a month or two ago (which I really liked). So I picked up a sample of a pricy 2023 Bai Hao Yin Zhen for reference. I also picked up a 2023 Jun Shan Yin Zhen, since I've really enjoyed even cheaper yellows in the past.

Both were definitely lookers, with really plump and fuzzy buds. I did gong fu brews of both, and really took my time with them. While they are different teas, I noticed some similarities, which I guess are related to the Yin Zhen quality. E.g. a starchy/dusty mouthfeel, a very light body (low astringency), a more complex but subtle (muted) aroma, and a nice buzz.

While they were high quality without a doubt, I struggled to enjoy them. The Bai Hao in particular even made me a bit nauseated, probably because of the lingering, milky sweetness, which reminded me of flavours I don't enjoy (i.e. unripe avocado). I also struggled a bit with the complex aroma, which brought me to violets, raw pumpkin/cucumber, cassia cinnamon, and oats. I found it a bit strange and disharmonious.

The Jun Shan was very subtle, giving me mostly cocoa, but also some notes of hardwood sawdust. With the cheaper yellows I've had, the fuller body really helped to bring out the cocoa and oak (e.g. vanilla) notes, giving me a more chocolatey taste overall. Hence the Jun Shan felt almost lacking (or faulty) to me, even when disregarding the price. But I guess it's just not my cup of tea.

**Conclusion.** So I'm finding myself in the ""I want more body""-camp. I'll probably try brewing hotter and longer with the few grams I have left of each.

I would be happy to hear from any Yin Zhen fans here. What are your experiences? What do you enjoy? Is there a lot of variability? Does age make a very big difference?",GentleMinty,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/18vyrch/yin_zhen_overhyped_or_an_acquired_taste/

When I'm sick I use a big soup pan and a thermometer to steep green tea, then lid it and ladle it into a mug all day. I turn it on low every hour or two to make sure it hits ~180°F at least every four hours. I keep it lidded all day. These steps seem to prevent it from going stale and tannin-y. I'm also using good loose leaf green tea. I do this so I can always have tea readily available when my throat is sore. The few minutes of making a fresh batch each time always feel so long and awful, especially the seventh time I've done it in a day.

18vd6yy,"iTeaworld brings the heat, they fixed their main issue, and my rambling review of it",36,11,,"I am back with another iteaworld review on this lovely New Year’s Eve. My strategy for this review is to drink 3 cups of each tea back to back and then write my thoughts at the same time. You’ll have to bear with me just as my stomach will have to bear all this liquid caffeine for breakfast. 

I’ll start by saying I was asked to write another review for iteaworld, and I politely declined the offer because my life is too busy right now. The package of oolong showed up anyways, and I guess I am a sucker because here I am writing a review. I am glad they disregarded my wishes because they truly brought the heat on this sampler. It also gave me something to do on what is my least favorite holiday of the year by far. 

In my opinion the biggest thing holding back these samplers was the 3g bag weight. It was just a little too low to have a proper gong fu sessions, and it’d be weird to western brew these teas. This most recent sampler is a generous 5 grams and it is a perfect sample size now. I generally put around 7-8 grams in my 120 ml pot but that’s because I have way too much tea sitting around. 

So let’s jump right into the review. I’ll put myself on the record by saying I am not the world’s biggest oolong lover. I do lean more towards greener oolongs though. I have also written 3 reviews on this company so if you want some info on who they are and what they are trying to do, i’ll link that in my comment section. 

Tieguayin

Up first is the oolong that everyone knows and loves, Tieguanyin. This is a one bud and two leaves picking from Spring 2023. Someone commented on my post saying they were impressed I can read fluently speak Chinese. This is obviously true and I will say that Tieguanyin translates to merciful tin can man. You can trust me, don’t google it. 

The nose on this tea comes across grassy and floral. There is some nuttiness and lavender as well. As always I get some cooked green notes like kale and roasted brussel sprouts. This has a more complex aroma than other TGY I have tried. 

I am ripping all of these teas at full boil, which typically isn’t what i’d do for green oolongs. Contrary to popular belief though, you can go full boil on all Chinese teas if you want. I let the first steeps run long so I can pull out a lot of flavor to make reviewing it easier. The first steep has a lot of steamed greens flavor. Once again, a surprising amount of complexity in it. Hint of sweetness. On the later steeps it mellows out to a more typical TGY flavor profile. Buttery sweetness and a creamy mouthfeel. Zero umami notes in this tea, which is something I usually find in green oolongs. I actually find this to be exceptionally good, and it really outclasses some other TGY on complexity. 

Zhangping Shui Xan

I am already looking forward to trying this oolong because I have never had a pressed oolong. The little hints of purple on the leaves excites me too. This is also one bud with two leaves from Spring 2023. An amusing side note is that their website says “slightly firework aroma” as a descriptor for this tea.

The aroma of this tea is absolutely phenomenal. Hands down it is the best smelling oolong I have experienced. It is an absolute nut bomb or roast toasty goodness. Apple pie and praline pecans. 

The taste completely turned 180 into a strong berry fruitiness. Some nuttiness lingers but now it is onto apples and frozen berries. A hint of astringency just enough to let you know it’s there. This tea is truly special, and I think this is an oolong that is made for puer lovers. It’s strong but balanced. This is probably my second favorite oolong of all time. 

6 cups of tea down and my body is letting me know that it hates me. I won’t listen though and power on through. 

Da Hong Pao

This is probably the second most well known oolong out of china. 99% of posts from people trying to identify their tea gifts and Tieguanyin or Da Hong Pao. I’ll set my expectations accordingly because I am not the biggest fan of Da Hong Pao. This is a one bud with two leaves from Spring 2023 (they are all the same so I should’ve just said that up front). 

Some great savory smokiness in the aroma. Smoked meats and dark chocolate cherries. Some jellied fruits is back in this one which has been a constant of the silver teapot that I have been trying to avoid. 

As I expected the flavor on it is not as nice as the aroma. I’m getting dark fruit and some malt. Pleasant astringency but it’s just a little one note overall. It’s good but I didn’t really expect to love this one and that held true. I’m not a professional though so maybe I just suck at brewing DHP, so you can tell me I am an idiot in the comments. 

Fenghuang Dancong

This is allegedly from 100+ year old trees. I have some opinions on that but I am not going to get into that in this post. I’m not 100 years old though so who knows. 

As expected the aroma of this is powerfully floral and full of honey. At this point after a lot of tea is usually where my brain stops working so well. I also burnt the shit out of tongue on this brew. I’ll say something really specific about the aroma, and it’s that it reminds me of subway flatbread. 

Regardless, I found this tea to be better than the DHP. Super berry forward flavor with a nice roasted balance to round it out.

When I first heard about iteaworld, I expected them to have lower quality offerings than what I currently drink. This is 100% not the case though, as they truly bring a really solid product to the market. I’ll briefly mention their focus on sustainability and information about the teas that makes this a great place for beginners. 

I’ll happily give this sampler my stamp of approval and it would make a great gift to someone trying to get into Chinese teas. It also comes with tea bags made out of corn starch I believe for those without a gong fu setup. I’ll probably end up cold brewing this sampler as well because I love an iced oolong. 

I hope 2024 is a great year for everyone and that we can leave behind the bad stuff in 2023. 

Thank you to iteaworld for sending me this oolong sampler I didn’t want because it turned out awesome.",Rip--Van--Winkle,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18vd6yy

18vda4j,Trying to Replicate local Korean Restaurant Barley Tea,11,19,,"Hi, my wife and I love the tea at the local Korean restaurant so we asked the owner and she said it's barley tea.   So we ordered this from amazon ( [Amazon.com: Dongsuh Roasted Barley Tea, 10g x 30 bags : Everything Else](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038L2L0A/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ) and it's very good but not the same.   

What is odd, the tea at the Korean place tastes just like really yummy brown rice (but also kind of like the tea we got from amazon too).   The tea at the Korean place doesn't taste as roasted/toasted, it's far more smooth.   I am still not convinced it's not brown rice tea but from what I can tell all brown rice tea is mixed with some kind of tea leaves, and this most definitely doesn't have any herbal tea flavor in it at all.   And definitely no caffeine.

Any ideas how we can replicate this amazing tea drink?  Thanks

18vfc4r,Tea Advent Calendar Review 2023 - Yawn's Tea For Two Advent Calendar,5,0,self,"Last year I posted a review of [Tea Forte's 2022 advent calendar](https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/zuqp1u/tea_fortes_teafilled_advent_calendar_a_review/) and this year we decided to repeat the exercise with Yawn Brew's [Tea For Two](https://yawnbrew.com/collections/tea-advents) calendar.

# TL;DR

All in all a great sampler with very good value (50 tea bags in total for less than $40) and a lot of decent teas, if a bit heavily skewed toward holiday-themed flavors.

Pros:

* Loved that it came with 2 infusers per day
* Decent amount of black teas (about half)
* Good variety (black, green, herbal, maté, oolong, rooibos)
* Less overwhelming use of added flavors (tended to smell strongly, but taste mild)
* Nice sachets with long strings
* Pretty inexpensive!

Cons:

* Overuse of a few ingredients, like Safflower, Cornflower, Calendula
* Some unnecessary coloring
* Still a lot of overly complex blends

# Contents and Average Rating

The box was about half black teas, 4 of which had no added flavors, while the other 9 plus the remainder of the box all had some manner of herbal additions and/or natural flavors. Full listing of tea ingredients at the end of the post.

This is a distribution of teas by type and how we rated them on average. My wife takes sugar in all the teas and a splash of milk in the black teas as well. I prefer neither sugar nor milk.

|Type|Number|Avg (Me)|Avg (Her)|Avg (Both)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Black|13|3.88|3.88|3.88|
|Green|2|3.25|2.25|2.75|
|Herbal|4|2.13|2.13|2.13|
|Maté|1|1.50|3.50|2.50|
|Oolong|1|3.50|3.00|3.25|
|Rooibos|3|3.50|4.00|3.75|
|Grand Total|24|3.38|3.42|3.40|

As with last year, black tea was still a top choice for both of us, but I think we've both gained in appreciation for the Rooibos blends and the 3 included in this box were tasty. This box was fortunately light on the flavored greens and herbals, and in general we liked this year's herbals even less than last year, though the Sleepy Head was not bad and both green teas were much less overpowering than some of the other flavored greens I've encountered.

Ultimately most of the black and rooibos teas fell in the 3.5-4 range for us and I attribute this to the overuse of various petals in some of their blends that distract from the other flavors. In particular, I thought the cornflower and maybe calendula created sort of un-tea-like flavors in otherwise good black blends. It didn't ruin them, but I think it gave them all a very similar, almost popcorn-y smell that didn't improve the experience.

# Standouts

## Favorites

1. Irish Cream Breakfast: 5 (her), 4.5 (me) - The only tea to get a full 5 points from either of us, this was a hearty breakfast tea with just a hint of added flavor, though less than the name might imply.
2. Scottish Breakfast: 4.5 (both) - A super solid favorite that tells you the kind of teas we enjoy.
3. Cookie: 4.5 (her) 4 (me) / Gingerbread: 4 (her) 4.5 (me) - Our two favorite flavored blacks. Both of these had strong warming smells, but tasted primarily like black teas with a little spice. If you like a mexican hot chocolate or similar tea, you might enjoy.
4. Pear Cinnamon: 4.5 (her) 4 (me) - The best Rooibos in the bunch, it again had a strong aroma without having an overpowering artificial flavor. Very pleasant.

## Misses

0. Margaret's Hope Darjeeling: 2.5 (her) 3.0 (me) - This was the black tea we cared for the least, though I thought it wasn't too bad; I just tend to prefer other black teas over its sort of mild and musky flavor.
1. Morning Maté: 3.5 (her) 1.5 (me) - I really didn't care for this and thought it was one of the worst for artificial flavors, but my wife really enjoyed it! Perhaps a sign that you should put a little sugar in it.
2. Cinnamon Green: 1.5 (her) 3.0 (me) - The reverse of the above, I was surprised that I didn't hate this green tea. I was worried it would taste very artificial, as I have strongly disliked flavored greens in the past, but I found this to be pleasant enough and not too strongly flavored. My wife couldn't stand it though.
3. Toffee Apple: 2 (her) 2.5 (me) / Winter Berries: 2 (both) / Cranberry Apple: 2.5 (her) 1 (me) - I'm grouping them all together, because all three are very similar apple-based herbals that we both generally didn't like at all. Herbals are already an uphill battle for us, and these all leaned too heavily on apple with a mix of petals, none of which really created anything we wanted to drink.

18voorp,New Skagg EKG says serial number is already taken,0,15,,"I'm just getting more into drinking tea and treated myself to the Stagg EKG which came today.  When I tried to register it for the extra year warranty, the form spits it out and says invalid, that serial number is already taken.  And yes, I checked that it was entered correctly about 10 times.

It looked like new packaging, but I'm worried that it's a refurb or returned item and wondering if I should just return it at this point for a new one.  I don't see how else the serial number could already be in use.  I got it from Amazon.  I did contact Fellow support, but I'm not sure I should trust what they tell me, I'm sure it's going to be something like ""it's fine, we cleared the serial number so you can now register, don't worry, it's a new kettle.""

Should I just swap it for a new one now and save a possible future failure?

UPDATE:  Of course Fellows said what I expected, so I put in the return to Amazon.  And in using it before I ran into the serial number problem, I decided to go with the Corvo EKG instead.  The Stagg took a full 35 seconds to fill my 18 oz mug and the temperature in the mug was 20°F cooler just from pouring.  But I ordered direct from Fellow, one benefit is they only charged me 6.25% state tax instead of Amazon's 10% that includes county tax.  I still have a hard time justifying the price, but that thing is just so damn beautiful!

The cracks are only on the inside, very fine, and only visible in good lighting (sunlight or lamp). You can also feel the cracks.

The big one on the side is visible in the pictures, the other one is right in the center, not visible in the pictures.

Edit: Interestingly, the center and the spot with the visible crack dry instantly, while the rest of the pot stays wet much longer.

When I asked her why she steeped it so short, she said it was because any longer would make it bitter. I asked if it was just that specific variety, and she said no, she does it for all her black teas. She even seemed surprised when I said I steeped mine at home for about three minutes, asking me if I thought the taste was bad steeping it so long. 

She knew what she was doing, at least to me, so this isn't me questioning her expertise, it's more that I'd never heard of this. Obviously steeping it such a short time isn't going to hurt the tea, and tea taste is also so subjective. There was a language barrier so I didn't really have the chance to dive into the question further with her, so I thought I'd ask here to see if anyone's aware of a Chinese tradition around tea steeping for such a short time.

18uddkt,Some very gao gaoshan tasting,43,2,,"Was able to score some winter 22/23 goashan oolong of the Qinxing varietal that was grown at 2650 metres. This tea was expertly prepared by tea roaster Lee Ming Fan, and is a fair bit more expensive than other oolongs from this area (Hua Gung / Water Source Peak).

Dry leaf smell was peppery, woody and almost saltbush-like. 

I start the gongfu session with a 45 second opening steep with 95 degree water, to open up the tea balls. 

The wet leaf smell is almost meat broth like. Savoury, somewhat spiced, vegetable and very enticing. 

Notes of savoury vegetables, mildly astringent fruits and underlay of spiced woods. Lots of activity in the mouth and in the throat. The tea is thick and almost creamy in texture. 

The mountain rhythm is exceptional. As good as the very best DYL I've had years ago when 2600 metre DYL was still reasonably available. 

There is an interesting cold slate note. The locals call it ""cold rhythm"". 

The chi is incredible. Tingling in the cheeks, scalp and back of neck. Keep in mind that I'm well accustomed to tea and can drink up to 4 gongfu sessions a day, so for me to feel significant chi is unusual. This is the very first time that a tea has also caused my arm (triceps) to tingle. 

Longevity is Incredible for a green oolong, and I continue to extract very good soup even beyond the 6th steep. 

Overall this tea is incredible, one of the very best I've had this year. The mountain rhythm and cold rhythm makes this a rarerified experience. It's reignited my interest in finding more high quality goashan. I'll be exploring a few more Lishan plantations and tea makers next year!",OudSmoothie,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18uddkt

The shop is far more of an English Tea style place though, and only has 2 kinds of mini Pu'erh cakes and a couple 100g cake selections. The employees don't even drink Pu'erh and didn't have much to say about them before i bought them to try.

I LOVE the flavor profiles though, and have picked up a few more here and there over the past year.

Two issues. I still haven't tried a quality Sheng yet, and don't know where to start looking for one, and two, i don't know anyone in person who's into tea at all to talk to about it.

I'm looking to spend a bit of money on a few kinds now that the Holidays are over and i can afford to spend some money on myself again.

An idea of my taste preference:

My favorites so far are a Silver Needle White Pu'erh, a Sticky Rice Pu'erh (Done with an herb, not actual rice like Genmaicha) and i had 2 glasses of some ancient tree Pu'erh at a cultural festival in town last year that reminded me of an almost Jasmine Oolong with a much more complex profile.

I do not like most standard black teas, always leaning towards Greens/whites/Oolongs. Jasmine is always a hit with my palate, lol. My daily go-to are hand rolled Green Jasmine pearls, Frontier's Oolong, and the Silver Needle White Pu'erh listed above.

I’m relatively new to the US and am having a tough time finding brands that I like.  Back in South Africa I had a lifetime of trial and error to hone in on brands and vendors that I enjoyed.

I need some help to identify some brands or tea vendors that I could try out - although - and from what I can tell, the consensus around here is to promote loose leaf tea - I just generally enjoy having my tea arrive bagged.  Back home I was lucky enough to find vendors that supplied premium teas that were bagged and bespoke and gorgeous and it’s become how I enjoy my tea.  Are there any established small companies that you guys recommend I try?

I like trying all teas - although the flavor profiles that I find myself going back to include, jasmine green (probably my absolute favorite), earl grey, licorice, apple/cinnamon, anything spicy like chai/cardamom, anything citrusy… mmmm yum!!!!

Thanks so much!!!
