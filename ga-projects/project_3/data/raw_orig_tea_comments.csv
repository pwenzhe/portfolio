Steamed leaves had aromas of plums, citrus, and chocolate.

Wow. This tea was stellar from the start.

Apricot finish with sweetness. Check.
Lovely nose with fruit and florality. Check.
Complex enjoyable palate. Check.
Silky mouthfeel with astringency. Check.

Aroma of cherries in empty cup.

Charcoal note on palate arrived and went away during session. Just the processing of the tea stopping by briefly to say hi.

Finish was very silky by 9th infusion.

Longevity: Check!

Minerality crept into nose on 12th infusion.

Great evolution: Check!

Finish became more like nice ripely sweet peaches near end of session.

By end of session, finish was fairly thick on back of tongue.
At just over $.50 per gram ($.53 if you buy 4 ounce bag), this tea is an incredible value. (Almost) Daily drinker price for a super enjoyable expression of the Honey Orchid form. You will have to spend significantly more to get something better.

This was not a fussy tea to brew either.

I would absolutely 100% buy more of this tea.

Did 1st to last comparisons. 2nd infusion was that lovely stone fruit nose and brisk apricot palate, while penultimate was peaches and minerality on the nose rounded over peaches on palate, thick mouthfeel, and that finish. 1st infusion was that beautiful beginning aroma on the nose, similat palate as 2nd, but with a little baker’s chocolate, while last was light nose and very rounded over palate, suggesting that leaves were done.

I nibbled on some of the spent leaves and even they tasted good. This is seriously everything I look for in a Honey Orchid tea.

199x34r,kiheo38,Indian teas such as Darjeeling and Assam.,38,Asdfguy87
199x34r,kiidonc,"Traditionally, Gong fu is used for Oolong. Fujian and Chaozhou area tea to be specific. 

Other area like Xihu or Westlake has their renowned Xihu Longing green tea which brew differently. 


Yunan where pu'er is famous also brew differently.

Huangshan is famous for their chrysanthemum tea, also brew differently. 

Matcha and Gyokuro are brewed differently.

So generally, if op understands that gong fu is that zhiza clay kettle. Then it's not suitable for all the tea and this is why it's fun to have different tea utensils.

But gong fu in the original sense means to brew with effort. That's the heart of it. So I think that means if you have Earl Gray, using English tea set would also be considered ""brewing with an effort""( to make best tea) and also proper brewing tool set for everything else. When considering this, every tea would be proper to be ""brewed with effort""  (gong fu). 

Thus, that's why some tea people have arrays of tea brewing tools from western tea kettle, indian and middle east tea set, Chinese sets, Japanese sets, etc.",11,WillAlwaysNerd
199x34r,kii492a,I'd say Japanese tea just because of how it's processed.  It releases flavour a lot faster and generally is a bit too small to be conveniently gong-fu'd.,7,RKSH4-Klara

199x34r,kih96kk,"Gongfu (aka chaozhou) brewing was traditionally suited to wuyi/dancong roasted oolongs. The internet tea communities' experimentality has applied the method to a variety of other teas with more (pu'er) and less (e.g. jasmine) success.


Larger leaf orthodox teas oolong/black/dark will fare well. Under the (relatively) radical (but not completely baseless) idea that Darjeelings should be classified as an oolong (for example), you'll find more adventurous gongfu-heads using their gaiwans for teas that aren't highish quality China oolongs/blacks/darks. ",18,james_the_wanderer
199x34r,kihvptn,Green tea like Long Jing. They are doing well Grandpa style,3,steakH
199x34r,kijfhla,"The right question is if there are tea types that Western brewing works as well or better for, but it's the same.

Gongfu brewing makes the most difference for sheng pu'er and twisted style oolongs, in my opinion, so for Wuyi Yancha and Dan Cong, as main oolong types.  For the highest quality rolled oolongs I would only use Gongfu brewing, but for low or lower medium quality rolled oolongs it doesn't really matter, results are similar either way.

Gongfu brewing doesn't work well for very broken black teas, or CTC tea, for flavored teas or tisane blends, or to me for a lot of green tea range.  That last case depends on preference, but again in general for more whole leaf versions Gongfu brewing is relatively better, and not as suitable for broken leaf material.

Shu pu'er can be brewed either way.  It might work out slightly better Gongfu brewed, but for lower or even average quality versions the difference is so minor that it's pretty much the same.  I would brew most white tea Gongfu style but it would be ok Western brewed.  Hei cha would vary by type and preference.

For a regional type like Darjeeling the mapping relates to the tea form, not the origin.  For whole-leaf versions of any oxidation level Gongfu brewing would work better, in my opinion, and for broken leaf versions Western brewing is probably better.",3,john-bkk
199x34r,kih3ek5,"Since 'gong fu cha' as we know it now (with a gaiwan) originated in the 18th century and all types of tea have been around for longer than that, I'd say all types.
A lot of teas can just be thrown in a big pot and boiled for hours on end.

Then again, 'gong fu' means you try to make tea the best way you can and every host serving tea to their guests in the best way possible is a timeless custom.

If you mean gong fun cha as we know it now, with the use of a gongdaobei, that has only gained popularity in the 20th century and I'd say Fu brick tea.",13,ibuzzinga

199sgna,kihofz5,"This is a difficult question. There are definitely red flags I look for, but it's more about developing intuition than specific criteria. Every ""rule"" in tea has exceptions. That said, here are things I ask when evaluating a new vendor, starting with the big picture:

* **Do they specialize in a specific region, or are they more generalist?**  Would you rather trust a restaurant serving Indian, Chinese, Mexican *and* Italian food, or one specializing in northern Thai? Usually, specialists are higher quality.

* **Is their selection largely flavored teas?** Nobody is going to cover up amazing tea in flavorings, so this is a sign they value popularity over quality. 

* **How many teas do they sell?** If they have 500 teas, it's unlikely they're doing any real curation. And unless they're selling huge volumes, their more obscure teas may be years old. 

* **What teaware do they sell?** A store can have garbage teaware and great tea so this isn't an immediate dealbreaker, but if I see $50 ""Yixing"" pots, easy gaiwans, tea pets, tea balls, etc., I'll definitely be wary. Even more so if the product photos come straight from Taobao, as is the case with Jesse.

* **What are their brewing instructions?** If they give the same directions for entire categories, that's a huge red flag. Gyokuro and longjing are both green teas, but they're brewed nothing alike. Putting teaspoons instead of grams is also problematic, since leaf size can vary a lot. Recommending temperatures lower than boiling for categories like puer, oolong or black tea also gives me pause, since lowering the temperature is a way to hide flaws in bad tea. Honestly, many of the best vendors don't bother with brewing instructions at all. There are infinite ways to brew any tea, and they assume their customers are experienced enough to know what they prefer. [Here's an example of a bad vendor.](https://silkroadteastore.com/collections/green-teas/products/sencha-green-tea)

After the big picture stuff, I'll look at specific categories. Puer is a good one, since most vendors fuck it up in obvious ways. If they only sell mini tuochas and flavored puer, that's a terrible sign. [This listing](https://silkroadteastore.com/collections/oolong-teas/products/pu-erh-tea) doesn't even say whether it's raw or ripe, which matters a lot because they taste completely different. I'll also look at green teas. It's not always easy to judge tea quality from dry leaves, but if their green teas are brown, that's concerning. 

Others have already pointed out some obvious marketing red flags (although there are exceptions for all of them), like making wild health claims, overemphasizing qi, and exaggerating tree ages. Beyond that, a good strategy is to figure out who is their intended audience. I wrote this the other day:

>Compare this [Upton Gyokuro](https://www.uptontea.com/japanese-green-tea/japanese-loose-leaf-green-tea/p/V00216/) to the same style from [Thes du Japon,](https://www.thes-du-japon.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=1522&language=en) a respected Japanese tea vendor. Thes du Japon lists the harvest date, cultivar, shading time, and specific region of origin. Upton, on the other hand, doesn't even list the harvest *year.*

Between those, it's obvious that Thes du Japon's description is written for more sophisticated customers. Upton's could describe *any* gyokuro, and gives no useful information to someone already familiar with the category. Even without knowing anything about those teas, I think anyone could guess which is better. 

Here's [another example.](https://daxuejiadao.com/products/heritage-niu-rou-2022) That's a super high-end vendor, so the description assumes their audience is already familiar with yancha, its cultivars, its terroirs, and how it's typically brewed. They give all the relevant information, but really the entire product page can be summed up as, ""Trust us. It's good."" Compare that to the same cultivar from [Mei Leaf.](https://meileaf.com/tea/orchard-stream/) Their audience is, apparently, people who need to watch a video to learn what a tea cultivar is. In other words, absolute beginners. And there's nothing wrong with appealing to novices—Thes du Japon does it well—but there's a difference between being beginner-friendly and treating beginners like morons who need their hands held. Mei Leaf is the latter.

Lastly, I'll try to find reviews from reliable sources (so...not Reddit). Tea Forum has some super knowledgeable people, or even old Steepster or Tea Chat threads if the vendor has been around for a while. Even still, there's no guaranteed way to judge a vendor. The only surefire solution is to taste a lot of tea and learn to recognize quality, then try a few teas from a new vendor before putting in huge orders. You'll still get some duds, but at least it will be minimized.",38,trickphilosophy208
199sgna,kigkhww,"I’ve primarily been using this sub’s search bar as my starting point for shopping, though there are also specialized subs like r/matcha and r/puer that are themselves a wealth of information for those specific categories of tea.

By searching things like “vendor recommendation”,  the type of tea I’m looking for, or a vendor’s name if I already know the name of a vendor but want to see more reviews, I can sift through r/tea’s history of posts asking for recommendations for specific types of tea and vendors for them. If there’s enough posts/comments on a vendor or tea, I can also compare the comments to look for positive and negative consistencies in the reviews.

From those recs, I look directly at the vendor sites, their listings, the tasting notes for those listings, and the reviews on them. If available, one can also cross-reference popular and/or year-round listings with reviews/comment threads on Steepster, TeaForum, TeaChat, etc., but one generally won’t find much for seasonal/limited listings.

Ultimately, the real test for any vendor or listing is to just buy and try. One can do all this research to help you narrow listings down from an overwhelming catalogue of things to try, or which vendors might be most convenient in terms of shipping times, cost efficiency to quality, services, etc. However, as with learning any hobby, experience is the best teacher - and one pays tuition in the form of purchasing the supplies for enabling that experience.",9,GachaSheep

My list is also short-

**Red Blossom Tea Company** in San Francisco for any Chinese teas. Whether it be green, white, oolong or pu’erh. Their selection isn’t the largest or overwhelming, but what they do have is **GREAT**. They also ship and usually have some free shipping promo going on. 

**Harney and Sons** for any **flavored** teas. Emphasis on the **flavored**. Their Chinese and Indian teas are lackluster, honestly. But where they shine is their flavored tea blends. By far they still have the most exceptional Earl Grey (the supreme) I’ve had. The Paris and London Fog are also quite tasty.

199sgna,kigdz7c,"I do it like I do almost everything in life. Trust my gut feelings. One of my first big tea orders was farmer leaf, because I really liked his youtube videos and went on his homepage and liked his statements he was making there (small scale, sustainability etc) and I loved, that he had videos of the tea farmers themselves. So I ordered and it was indeed really good tea.

Another order was with a big national tea seller in my country, that a friend of mine suggested. So I tried and from the beginning I didnt like the Webpage, I thought their about page was strange, they were talking more about being old timey tea vendors, than they talked about tea. But I trusted my friend more than my gut feeling at that moment and ordered some tea anyway (it helped that they also sold a Gaiwan I liked). Sure enough, it was really bad tea.

Or the often mentioned Mei Leaf. I like some of their videos, but to me it was clear from the beginning, that Don is a very excentric guy and he talks all the effing time about his tOp sHeLf tEa. So, I was guessing very early, that his prices were probably a bit steep, even before I came to this sub and read this from everybody...

199sgna,kih1of5,i avoid all vendors of tea bags. i try to see whether vendors actually visit the farmers and tea makers. I avoid vendors who offer muliple sources although that's not a hard rule. I like vendors that have  tea shops. Why? They brew and serve teas they sell. I don't like ceylon tea. I therefore don't patronize any of the somebody and somebody vendors. I'm learning all the time. I've been a long time matcha drinker too. For matcha I'm super choosey. I find them on sazen and ippodo. Recommendations from zen students.,4,chemrox409
199sgna,kih3hnx,"I think it's a too complex problem to hope for an easy solution. Because all feedback you can get (either in this post, or in the vendors list, ...) is a mixture of opinions from people with very different aims.

For example, some will dismiss vendors with too much flavoured tea - while others like exactly that kind of tea.

Some seek detailed information about the tea ... and might downgrade a vendor that doesn't supply any useful information at all (such as white2tea), no matter how good the tea might be.

Then, there is the big point of ""how well does the vendor's taste match your own""? I have a set of vendors that I like a lot and buy regularly from, but I won't buy all types of tea from all vendors: For example, I know from experience that I simply don't like the style of Sheng that one vendor normally offers; or another one might have the same Yancha taste as me, so I can blindly trust their descriptions and buy it there, which I would never do in other stores; and so on.
Or even just finding out which vendor's tasting notes are something you can relate to (and even use as a purchase criterion), or are totally ridiculous to you.

And all of this is something only you can find out for yourself, because those aren't objective quality markers.",4,TeaAndAI
199sgna,kiintzs,"The only way to know for sure what they carry is good is to order samples and try them.

Obviously, you can't try them all, unless you're rolling in $$$, so you'll have to rely on recommendations of others. 

I learned to taste tea in Singapore over the course of a few months with very high end yancha, so I can be pretty confident that my palette is good. I also don't expect to find anything of that quality for any remotely reasonable price, so for my daily drinkers, I don't look for something like those.

I generally look for enjoyable teas with good price/quality ratio. As they say, good thing no cheap, cheap thing no good. Expensive thing not necessarily good, so price is not necessarily a good hallmark of tea either.

Generally, the more specifics a vendor can offer about a tea speaks to its quality. For example, date of picking, season of picking, cultivar, region, etc.

A vague blend of ""2013 sheng puerh"" for example generally doesn't tick the box for quality in my book.

If a vendor has stuff sold out, that's generally a good thing. Firstly, it means they have to restock often, and they purchase small batches, because the production tends to be small. Small production means the farmer/processor is likely to have paid much more attention to the production of the tea. Not to say that all large batch production is bad, this is just an indicator.

Most vendors that specialize in a certain tea will have better tea of that type over generalists. A small selection of teas generally also indicates proper curation of that selection. 

A few red flags for me:

* Flavored tea - this is not tea, this is flavoring on tea leaves. I'm here for tea.
* Fruit tea - same as above. Leave it to the Starbucks mochafrappulattiato gals.
* Excessive marketing.

I think one of the things you need to learn to distinguish is who \*sells\* tea, and who \*markets\* tea. There is a big difference here. The tea marketers may not necessarily have bad tea, but they are almost certainly overpriced for their quality. They are here to appeal to the mass market, not us tea nerds.

On that note, I actually want to try Mei Leaf just to see why everyone hates on it so much. Obviously, they're overpriced. But is their tea that bad? Unfortunately, I live in the US and can't really justify the high shipping prices just to try it out for the hell of it.

Flavored and fruit tea also point to the target market of that store being the average westerner and not tea nerds like us. If their target market isn't us, the probability of us finding what we seek is very low.

Of course there are always exceptions, and as I stated in the beginning, the only way to know for sure is to try it yourself. Try ordering samples from a few vendors and taking it as a learning experience. You will develop intuition over time. These are merely guidelines to help you develop said intuition.",3,VeyrLaske
199sgna,kiiokv1,"I started drinking tea to try and up my water intake, but found myself getting sick of chamomile and herbal teas, but I wasnt a huge fan of regular tea either. I decided to try red blossom tea company first because I wanted to understand what really good tea can taste like. If I still wasn't big on tea and felt it was underwhelming, then I was going to just give up on trying to drink tea. However, I was pleasantly surprised by what I got from Red Blossom. From there I got some harney and sons but I have determined I don't like flavored teas, just personal preference. Then I decided to try Yunnan Sourcing, and I got this pot that you pour the water over the leaves in the top, and then it drains slowly through a hole into the subsequent pitcher, and that pot has changed my tea life.

It's so easy to get the tea leaves out compared to the metal tea balls and the like, and it effectively autosteeps for me, and it steeps like 400 milliliters at a time or something. I keep resteeping the same leaves until lunch time at work, and then I switch to a different tea after lunch for the rest of the day. I'm getting like 2 liters of tea throughout the day where previously I might have had one can of diet soda. 

At yunnan sourcing I have also been trying various teas, and the descriptions are so good that if I find I don't like a tea, they have already mentioned the flavor note I don't like so I'll know to avoid it on future purchases. I plan to continue purchasing from them until I run out of new teas to try.

Edit: Also just wanted to add I didn't know where to go either, I just based going to these places off what people have said on this sub. And about oolong on yunnan-- I have an orange blossom aroma oolong from them where I get hints of tangerine from it and it's extremely pleasant. It's one of my favorite teas now. I'm not well versed enough to know what makes a great oolong, but everything I have gotten from yunnan has been good to me or if I don't like it, then it at least matches its own description (earthy, or whatever).

Yunnan Sourcing do lots of curated samples. See list [HERE](https://yunnansourcing.com/en-gb/search?type=product&q=sampler*)

&#x200B;

I would reccommend White2Tea - for me they are very consistent and they make up a lot of my tea collection. 

They have been expanding their offering of the 7g ""dragon balls"" which are a single cup dose. They also offer 25g samples and 200g cakes.

White Tea dragon balls can be found [HERE](https://white2tea.com/search?type=product&q=white%20balls*)

They have a large selection of oolong teas in 25g, plus some dragon balls and 25g samples of cakes. Oolong list [HERE](https://white2tea.com/search?type=product&q=oolong*)

&#x200B;

I would say if you get a spread from White2Tea then you can't go far wrong.",2,Rob-79

Then again you research the shop and see if what is written as well as the price seems reasonable and then when you found your shop you see what kind of Instagram accounts they follow - maybe they follow other tea shops or even the farmers themselves who are also maybe selling their stuff. And so on and so on. It takes time :) but that's also the fun if it l. As you delve into it, more opens up.",1,QuantumEntanglements
199sgna,kijj24m,"You really need to base an understanding of the patterns that come up in tea vendor themes and approach through experience, and to try teas from different sources to map what people are saying to the actual experience.  You can tell that Yunnan Sourcing sells a broader range of types and versions than you can get to from browsing their site, but you need to try some teas to place how quality level and value vary there.  YS would probably be inconsistent by tea type; their sheng or shu pu'er offerings might be better and better value than their oolongs.  Even that probably doesn't work, as too general a statement; their range varies by finer level patterns.

I've tried tea from a lot of sources; that's how I approached it.  My budget didn't allow for free spending so what I did end up trying was inconsistent, based on hunches, and on people sending me free tea for review, as a tea blogger.  There are significant gaps; I never got around to trying anything from White 2 Tea, even though they are regarded as a pretty decent source, and I drink mostly sheng, their main type offering.

It's hard to convert this to advice for you.  The patterns people describe here, when they try that, kind of work, but exceptions come up as often as the generalities.  You can't go by forms of product descriptions or how good brewing instructions are; that varies by too many other factors, related to how vendors see marketing, or what they focus on personally.  It is a ""red flag"" if a shop or online outlet carries a lot of many types of tea versus having a focus, but even that is unreliable.  Value (quality in comparison with cost) relates to commercial choices on the vendor end, and how good their sources are, and you can't sort that out very easily.  This focus versus diversity theme connects with value; a vendor buying teas from a generic wholesale outlet will sometimes buy at worse value at wholesale level and not have access to better quality versions, versus a more direct purchaser.

It might work better to focus on what you are interested in and not tea sourcing in general, since that cuts back your workload.  Your mention of ""samplers of white tea and oolong"" is a little problematic because those are really broad ranges.  Both are produced in many places in many styles.  If you wanted to buy a sample set of Taiwanese oolong, Wuyi Yancha, Dan Cong, and Fujian Bai Mu Dan and Shou Mei if you are looking to use one source then you're already narrowed down to a very generalist vendor.

The quality level you want to find changes everything.  I would assume that for being new to the process medium quality, or low-medium quality, is fine, and cost is as much of a concern, which shifts things.  A vendor like Adagio might not be so bad, although I don't know if they sell any sample sets.  Rishi--another broad type source--might sell better tea at a better value (although I don't know that, even though it's my guess they probably do) but they sell at higher volume than Adagio, so they're out.  This initial constraint turns out to be problematic for the reason coming up here; an outlet like Yunnan Sourcing might sell a broad range of samples (individually, usually not as sets), but some might feel that it's not the best place to buy teas outside of Yunnan, where they originally specialized, evident in the name.

Early on in my tea exploration I came into contact with a Chinese small-business vendor who sold samples as an option, equivalent to a small US vendor, but she was drawing on much better sourcing options, with a broader range of types and much better value.  That would tough to replicate.  King Tea Mall might be an alternative to Yunnan Sourcing arriving at a similar offering in a different way.  Both might be a little hit and miss related to quality and value for types outside their normal range (sheng or shu for both, I think), but both would probably be fine for early exploration.  Or a conventional online vendor based in China might be close to what I experienced, like this one:  [https://www.teasenz.com/wuyi-oolong-rock-tea-sampler](https://www.teasenz.com/wuyi-oolong-rock-tea-sampler).  I've had good luck with that particular vendor, but their teas would probably be a little inconsistent, compared to narrowly focused vendors.  Later in your exploration those other types of vendors may be more suitable, like this one:  https://www.wuyiorigin.com/",1,john-bkk
199sgna,kijnygu,Beware any recommendations you get on Reddit. There’s a few vendors in particular who have their hooks deep in the tea subs.

Try TeaForum instead.,1,Moye16
199sgna,kik033f,"This is a great question.

I'd start with asking tea friends where they buy. But maybe you're someone's tea friend so you don't really have anyone to ask. 

At that point you enter the space of overwhelming options.  

For better or for worse, it's been a lot of trial and error to find my preferred vendors. Frankly, a good bit of money too.

Looking back I would say buy from shops that have a focus. That might be growing country/region or tea type. See how much info there is on the tea itself. Is there a farmer's name and that sort of stuff. However, this may not hold up for a large portion of conventional Japanese tea, for example as these are often blended. Basically, I think the more granular detail, the better.

The next step is a small purchase, nothing to break the bank, to see how it is. That's the gamble, but you never know until you try. 

Personally, I thought white 2 tea looked really cool. Decided to give them a try. Wasn't too impressed, but so many people loved them so I decided to try again. Still not for me. Started looking again and found a farmer leaf. For now, they seem to be the supplier for me.

199vnrw,kihotiv,"Assam black teas have a generally quite different flavor profile from Ceylon black teas (or Yunnan).

It is a inexpensive tea, but I recommend Ahmad Kalami Assam loose leaf. It has a hint of fruitiness I love, and is great with generous use of milk. Assam teas are pretty variable between malty/fruity/bitter depending on the tea, the leaf size, etc. Use a good heaping teaspoon of tea in a generous-sized cup or mug. Heat the water until it is _just_ beginning to boil (steaming, the first small bubbles starting), and then steep the tea for 3-4 minutes. Try that, and depending on your taste, you _might_ extend the steeping time. Note that Hong Kong style milk tea often uses evaporated milk and condensed milk, so using fresh milk would taste rather different. 

However, you might find that Assam just isn't your thing. It's a wide tea world out there. If you'd like to experiment with Ceylon tea, then affordable versions can be found. 

You should also try your black tea with the milk, since that's your goal. It's going to be a very different drinking experience without the milk and with. You're not after the same brewing goals here. You might even want to steep the tea to be stronger (steep a lot longer) than you'd want to drink straight, and then turn it into milk tea. Remember that things like Builder's Tea (in England) or Milk Tea (in Hong Kong), or even Indian Chai all originally became popular as robust and tasty beverages for laborers. They all make use of strong brews that might be harsh, but which were cheap, and then they were transformed by milk and sugar (and spice in the case of Indian Chai), to create joy out of poverty. Poor people made these things out of the tea that the fancy people wouldn't drink, originally. So, good milk tea might not be made from tea that you'd ever want to sip freshly brewed without any additions.",11,celticchrys

But my Assam has a very nice flavor despite the harshness and I enjoy it. And very pleasant with a little milk. It's somewhat malty (I've drunk more maltier teas though), but it's the flavor that I mainly like.

I am not sure if ""sweeter"" teas are produced in India at all, that's an interesting question.

My guesses: your hot water tank is badly in need of a flush out. A build of minerals... or if it's not hot enough bacteria... could cause the problem. It could be rust in the tank too. Either way, do a flush (you should be doing this every year or so anyway) to reduce the build up at the bottom and (if electric) check that the anode rod to make sure it's intact. Replace if it's rusted.

Other possibilities - do they wash their hands before handling food? Maybe they just suck at rinsing and are getting soapy water in your drink.

Maybe the make the tea differently. If the tea is poured in too hot, steeped too long etc it can take on a different taste.

I have relatives in California and their water is really hard and I use filtered water or else the tea is noticeably affected.

You can basically taste the hardness. A brita filter doesn´t remove *all* ions, so for me it is shifting the concentration in a better direction.

[Highland Spring](https://highlandspring.com/products) has higher hardness than yours and is considered a good water for tea in the UK. 

There is a question of taste and different water even within the same hardness will vary significantly. I found that Brita does nothing good on London Water and doesn't even drop hardness enough to reduce scale. 

However, I tried RO water with custom remineralisation and that has been a tea game changer. That said I noticed that tea flavour was robust to a lot of variance in remineralisation (eg: I double the drops with not much effect, good or bad)",1,FriendlyGuitard
199okvo,kigktqe,"Just make sure you don't use Brita elite/longlast filters.

They do not do the same thing that people suggest using brita filters for.

Brita Elite/LongLast creates something closer to distilled than anything and that will be awful.

That being said, if you grew up with that water, you likely got used to it and may simply prefer it to brita water.

Have you tried just the water compared to each other?

You wouldn't be ""wrong"" for just being biased if that is the reason.

People like different things and its fine to like something that others suggest could be improved instead. No one is saying its a guarantee or a requirement to use a brita filter. But it works for enough folks that its worth recommending to give it a shot.",1,Global_Lock_2049

So, yeah, my best guess is its removing something that is affecting extraction (from the sounds of it, seems it causes under extraction somehow).

199xyck,kihybp3,I could understand that being an issue especially with the strainer that comes with the Kiyoshi Luxury Tetsubin! It certainly won't work for Gong Fu style brewing. But I assume with a deep enough tea strainer or just pouring it through a strainer it would work.,1,WaterCello
199xyck,kii20y8,"Using this kind of  kettle's like a teapot will be just a nightmare. If you want a teapot I would suggest considering something else, like a glazed side handled kyusu, gaiwan, shiboridashi, [Hairo kyusu](https://www.coffeedesk.pl/product/866/Hario-Chacha-Kyusu-Maru-Czajniczek-Do-Zaparzania-Herbaty-450Ml?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAtaOtBhCwARIsAN_x-3IPlOsvTxJzvhQWMgGwfG9WDM7xy8hMWOypjahNk_ozCWzKpJWOGJQaAlmeEALw_wcB) (strainer is relatively law so it's ± ok), houhin etc. What is important is that every of them has some sort of a strainer (besides of hairo kyusu, the strainer is either built up, or a shape of the vessel itself works as a strainer like in say gaiwan, so you can pour small amount of leaves if you want, which is very good). If you are interested in materials that will affect the tea taste then you might be interested in unglazed teapots from clay, like tokoname clay, yixing clay etc.  you can read about it further. 

If you want some relatively big vessel that's convenient and will be quite neutral them I'd say that side handled glazed [glazed vessel will have neutral effect on tea] kyusu teapots are very good (they are my favorite for that purpose). Oftenly they are pretty big (say for example 400ml which is a  big amount for tea. You gonna to also remember that typically tea can be brewed multiple times), ans have built in strainer (typically around the spout or so, so the bottom of it is ""accesible"" for the leaves) so  the leaves are in contact with water no matter  how small amount of water you pour. You can also easily adjust  amount of water for your needs.

This kind of kettles you sent don't have deep strainers, at least I never saw one.   In your link  with the more expensive kettle they also  linked the video where they use it exactly as a kettle, they don't brew tea in it.

In Leiden there is also a store that sells high end french tea from Mariage Frères (Exclusivithee). Some tea is delicious but it is above my paygrade.. 

In Haarlem there is The Art of Tea and Spices. This store is giant. They have so many teas, cups, pots, everything. Haarlem actually has a couple of tea stores. At Tea My Dear you can do workshops as well. I once went on a tea trip with a friend through Haarlem and it was lots of fun. Came home with way  too much tea.

So if you find it hard to decide what to get online or the delivery time is too long, my advise is to go to a tea store and ask them for advise.

Smoke on the nose along with a little humidity and camphor.
Finish was fairly thick and coated the mouth.
Empty cup had aromas of plums.

Camphor on nose increased on 5th infusion.

Mouthfeel was enjoyable silkiness with some astringency.

Palate was brisk smokiness on 6th infusion.
Finish was dark cherries and maybe some plums. I kept thinking “juicy” while drinking this puerh.

This sheng was like Thick Zen Supremacy Electric Boogaloo in 3D. You can read that review here: https://alexsteanotes.blogspot.com/2024/01/2023-09-29-puerh-junky-07-thick-zen.html

Where Thick Zen was forest floor and mushrooms, with thick apricot finish, this puerh is smoke, camphor, and thick dark cherry/plum finish.

Did first to last comparisons. 2nd infusion was light smoke and sweet cherries, while penultimate was rounded over dark stone fruit. 1st was very light nose with camphor palate, while last was rounded over, but the leaves still had one or two infusions left to give if I were so inclined (I was not as it was late).

This tea had excellent endurance and was very plug and play (easy to brew enjoyably with predictable infusion intervals).

Specific to tea: by riding from Kandy to Nuwara Eliya, I rode past many tea plantations, and saw tea being tended and picked. I took some rest stops at plantations and drank tea at them. 

From Nuwara Elilya, I toured an ""ethical"" tea plantation near the Lover's Leap area. Our tour took us through the processing plant, where tea was dried and graded. They had huge sacks of tea stacked in a warehouse - I am not sure where they go to for packaging for export from there. 

As we descended into Ella, I stopped at various tea shops along the way.

There are downsides to cycling through the tea regions - the climb up to Nuwara Eliya was endless, and an icy rainstorm broke out near the summit. The section to Ella had lots of ups and downs, and we had another wild rainstorm. (Sri Lanka had the heaviest rain storms I've ever ridden through, and I've done a fair bit of international touring.)

1992x7f,kibb0jy,"I'm an avid coffee enjoyer as well as a former barista, and I will say that tea offerings at cafes are so often quite dreadful. If you focus on having high quality coffee, I think your tea quality should match. Amazon isn't a great place to get high quality tea, I would recommend looking at getting a wholesale account with a tea supplier, as the tea will be considerably cheaper this way as well as allow you to get higher quality tea. I'd recommend a brand like Hugo Tea, which has a paired back, refined selection of teas that are generally approachable, as well as within your price range. A couple others to look at may be Royal Tea New York(although their minimum purchase requirements are quite high), The Tao of Tea, even Rishi tea as well as a few more brands that aren't coming to me right now are all great places to get teas for a coffee shop. My former employer also has a decent tea selection available wholesale(primarily consisting of approachable blends if that's your thing). 

Generally for teas you wanna stock:

Some sort of chai(always a big seller)
Herbal blends(caffeine free)
And depending on how much tea you guys sell, likely one tea from the main types of tea(black/red, oolong, green, white)

As for specific teas it really depends on your demographic. If you've got a base appreciating super high quality coffee then I'd recommend finding some equally high quality teas(maybe even some puers), but in a lot of area blends, traditional breakfast style teas, and standard quality oolongs and greens may be more fitting.

Ideally I'd prefer a shop that has a deeper knowledge of only a few teas over one that has a wide selection but doesn't treat any of them well.

As for which styles to sell, unless you can control (lower) the water temperature, I'd be careful with green teas. Definitely at least one black though, maybe a Taiwanese oolong, matcha for lattes and a white tea. Most tea drinkers in the US drink iced tea, so a solid cold brew option or two would be nice.

I would also get some Assam, Darjeeling, Sencha, Genmaicha, a chinese green maybe, Oolong and a Puerh. Caffeine-free options: Chamomile, Peppermint. Fresh mint was a star everywhere I worked (leaf only, no stems). For start, is not a lot of stock but covers pretty much all and you will see which ones sell the best.

I’d start with what your best selling teas are today and make sure you keep those styles on your menu.

If you sell a lot of chai lattes or London fogs, Tanglewood makes some nice concentrates that my local cafe uses.

Use loose leaf tea in a large filter or large, high quality tea bags to allow the tea to circulate and brew properly.

Either time the brew yourself and deliver when it's done, or give it to me with a cute timer and a place to put the tea filter when it's done. A cup of hot water, a tea bag, and an ""it needs to steep"" feels like an insult unless it's priced substantially below the coffee items that come out ready to drink. 

Offer one mug size and a few pot sizes. I'm sitting here to sip so if I get a larger size I want it to stay warm, or if I'm here with a friend I like the cozy aspect of pouring for each of us.

1992x7f,kibn6ir,"What people expect for tea out of a coffee shop is a bit different than what I think a lot of people here would pick.  I do think carrying decent quality, traditional loose leaf is good, but realistically people are going to want a few flavored blends. 

For straight tea, English breakfast is kind of expected and you can make a latte out of it.  I think sencha and genmaicha are easy to source and brew strong and cheap.  You could also add a Chinese green tea like gunpowder to represent pan fried and steamed greens.  Hojicha is a roasted green tea, I’ve seen some cafes offer it as a tea latte, which I haven’t tried but might be interesting to experiment with.  I don’t see this at many cafes but cheap CTC Assam tea (Indian gunpowder) makes a really good milk tea.  I personally brew it stupid strong and add evaporated milk, similar to a Hong Kong style milk tea (which is another specialty thing you could look into).  A white tea like silver needle I think would round out straight teas.  I don’t think oolongs “pop” as well when brewed “western style”, but if you want to carry one that’s… provocative, I would definitely get duckshit oolong.  Great conversation starter.  Another wacky thing that might get people interested is puer, but sourcing good puer would be difficult, and I think a lot of people would find it far too strange.

Aside from traditional tea, earl grey is mandatory for London fogs.  A green mint tea in a Moroccan mint style is good.  For herbal teas I would do one rooibos offering of some kind, and probably something else that’s fruity like peach or something

The biggest choice for you will be to decide whether to do loose leaf, for which you need to buy and clean teapots. At comparable levels of quality, bags cost more for the tea, but you can just throw a tea bag and hot water into a cup. Loose leaf will give you a more elevated customer experience and a wider range of available high quality teas, but 

When I go to a restaurant or a coffee shop as someone who doesn’t like coffee and can’t really drink carbonated or alcoholic drinks right now, I am thankful if they have high quality tea bags, preferably the sachets with whole or broken leaf in them rather than the little bags of fannings or dust.

Hugo tea is an excellent choice: high quality and lovely presentation. Rather minimalist+quality.


I've been pleasantly surprised with Rishi tea at cafes before. In addition to your typical solid teas (black, red, chai, pu'er), they have some unexpected offerings, such as Silver Needle white tea and Quince Eucalyptus.

I love green tea, but I don't order from coffee shops because the extra hot water ruins it well before it's ever handed to me. IMO if you're only using one very hot temperature of water, it's not even worth carrying green or white teas, and you should stick to black and herbal. But assuming you do have the ability to steep things cooler...


Black teas: a breakfast blend, a decaf breakfast blend, masala chai (not necessarily a latte! Gotta be careful how it's phrased on the menu), something with orange, lapsang souchong (if you can keep it isolated from your other teas so they don't all go smokey), and some type of plain black tea where you can appreciate the terroir. Admittedly I'm not that into black tea so I'm out of my depth on the nicer varieties!



Green teas: jasmine (preferably scented with real flowers, not just an added flavor), genmaicha, a straightforward Japanese green like sencha, a straightforward Chinese green like dragonwell, a blend with something sharp/fruity/floral (rose, raspberry, that kind of thing), a blend with mint


White teas: a blend with some kind of stone fruit flavor/pieces, a plain white tea like silver needle - again I'm not super familiar, silver needle is just the main one I've heard of


Oolong: I know almost nothing about oolong. I know I like the ones I've tried! Look to other suggestions for specifics, as my only suggestion is to have some!


Puerh: if you can get some high quality stuff and can give people a big teapot of water so they can resteep as much as they want, go for it. Otherwise, skip it. Puerh is kinda weird and funky, so average drinkers may be turned away, while lovers of the stuff will be disappointed if it's not the good stuff. Mid or low grade puerh isn't going to appeal much to anyone! 


Herbals: plain chamomile, peppermint, spearmint, a tart and fruity blend (will probably have hibiscus or rose hips), a warm and spicy blend, rooibos/honeybush either plain or in a blend, chicory or a blend with chicory



Medicinal (subset of herbals): ginger (for upset stomach), raspberry leaf (for menstrual and pregnancy discomfort), and Throat Coat or a similar blend from a different brand - it'll have stuff like marshmallow root and slippery elm. Also, maybe something that just kinda smells and tastes like a medical tea. Do be careful when treading into medicinals though - I once consumed something that had senna leaf and I didn't know until afterwards that senna leaf definitely has an observable medical effect and that effect is as a laxative.

Option one - just go cheap and have it on the menu. People ordering it are the ones who just want something hot and don't want coffee. If they love tea, they probably aren't going to order it.

Option two - do some actual research learn to brew the tea. Maybe you charge a bit more. Have a good temperature controlled kettle, good sized mugs, and a brewing vessel. Invest in loose leaf teas from reputable sources. For to go cups, get empty tea bags you can fill. In house a individual tea pot is amazing, in mug infusers are cheaper.

198elg4,ki7mkw9,"Gosh Steepologie used to be local to me and I've purchased hundreds and hundreds of dollars worth of tea from them.

Their customer service is god awful. I've had multiple orders take MONTHS to ship. One order was marked domestic, organic and when I inquired about the month + delay, they said it was stuck at customs? Uhhhh? They eventually stopped replying after I checked in once a week. This went on about 5 weeks and they finally replied when I sent them memes. (Pablo Escobar waiting for steepologie). 

I've come to expect at least a 2 week delay from steepologie. 

This happened several times to my friends as well.

It's a shame because I have some solid favorites that I absolutely can't find anywhere.

They also nixed their rewards program, which I had about $100 left without notice. They claimed to notify me but I never got it. It was never announced, and they still mention the rewards program on their site. 

They also falsely advertised their ""membership"" tins as 10% off for life and stopped honoring them in store. Then they got rid of their retail locations. 

I'm really liking Chado as an alternative to steepologie blends. I'm still buying from steepologie because there's a handful of teas that are actually really fucking good and irreplaceable, but I do feel a bit stiffed. They do seem to be getting better after they created a chat/text line though.

One time I went in to get a bulk supply for a new tea I liked and brought in the 10% off tins. I had an existing tea that was very mid in the tins and was hoping to get a refill of one I liked in the tin, and transfer the mid one into a resealable bag. They'd done this for me before without me asking, because I sometimes pick out more teas than I come in for (and bought much bigger quantities than what I had left in the tin) so I didn't think it would be such a big deal. 

The lady in store went off at me about how they can't just give bags because bags cost money and how I needed to buy another tin if I wanted the 10% discount.

I asked if I could just pay for a bag then, and she refused, saying that it won't be fresh anymore and how the store label actually means something, yadda yadda. I thought about asking her to just dump it then because I wasn't actually enjoying that tea, but I didn't want to be rude so I just left. 

When they had their physical stores, they were suuuper pushy about their ""just bring the tins in and get 10% off for life"" tins but they made up new exceptions each time you went in (at first it was a discount on anything above 2g, then 4g, etc) that it was clear that they'd do anything to renege on their ""membership"" program.

It sucks because spending that much money on teas means that I've drank their tea for years and smell is so damned important to mood and routine. I found several teas that just absolutely fucking slap, but I guess I just need to just start phasing in more teas.

Then, about 20 years ago, disaster hit. I could no longer stand very sweet stuff and even performed the blasphemy of starting to drink tea hot. These days I rarely even drink cold tea but I go through large amounts of hot tea daily whether plain black bagged tea or some type of herbal or my favorite, earl grey.

1992qmz,kicudp5,"I used to think of the way we drank iced tea as southern sangria or sorts.  Really cold tea piled with peaches and berries or apples and pears.  Sometimes several kinds of mint and lemon balm, tarragon and rose pedals.  Basically whatever you could stretch tea with that was cheap and available and not have to use sugar.  

I am not exactly sure where this came from as most everyone else maybe a bit of lemon or mint in theirs with tons of sugar, but I believe my German-swiss Oma was one of the biggest reasons.  Refined sugar was something that was insanely expensive when she was a kid so that usually was only for the most special things. Fruit though, that grew on trees in the back yard, the mint would grow over a meter high so you had to keep it down somehow.  

The only difference in the way that I make iced tea now is I do cold crash mine.  I love my iced tea super fresh, so I'm not going to wait for it to cool down.  Ice cubes and frozen fruit and bam... Iced cold southern sangria.  And drinking it from a mason jar is a must.",5,rebar_mo

I grew up drinking sun tea w/o sugar and still drink a ton of iced tea / cold brew tea of many varieties. Still unsweetened.

For me it’s just a tasty tasty thing to drink that I like in a lot of circumstances. I love wine also and personally have never equated the two - like with a fine meal I would drink water not tea, and wine if I want it. In the summer I drink iced tea with breakfast. Obviously not wine. I take iced tea hiking.  Etc.

And every year I get 2-3 half gallons of sweet tea from mcdonalds for us to drink during Thanksgiving or Christmas. I dont go very long without drinking sweet tea. I always either have some pure leaf, arizona, or some sweet tea from a chinese restaurant in our fridge at all times. It is literally the drink that brings us all together down south. It is most definitely my favorite drink by a long shot. I cant wait to get into hot tea as much as sweet/iced tea, and figure out which ones taste the best to me.",1,PeacePrestigious873

Let’s say you choose black tea, then Google “types of black tea” and read until you find a specific black tea that you find interesting. 

If you want to go straight to high quality tea, ordering from White2Tea or Yunnan Sourcing is a great choice. Just try some mini samples and see what you like. Then order bigger amounts, after you know what you want. Or just find some local vendor that imports good quality loose tea from i.e. China, Japan, Taiwan, India etc. You can also read a bit about these countries’ tea to find out what you like.

Steamed ball had aromas of dates.

Smoke on the nose.
Dark raisins on the palate.
Nice lightly sweet cherry finish.
Silky mouthfeel with nice astringency.

Camphor crept into the nose by 9th infusion.

This tea was pretty bold, which was a nice change of pace from some of the thinner teas I tried recently, particularly from White2Tea.

By 12th infusion, smoke and camphor had receded a bit and raisins became more prominent.
Palate evolved to be more muscat grapes and cherries by this time. Finish followed suit.

This tea had good endurance.

Did first to last comparisons. 2nd infusion was smoke on the nose and light sweetness, while penultimate was muscat grapes on the nose and rounded raisin fruits with that finish. 1st infusion was just very light all around, while last was very rounded showing the leaves had nothing more to give.

There’s definitely a lack of a channel that produces consistent reviews of teas from really any of the popular vendors. One of the biggest issues I see with people who are new to the hobby is the vast and overwhelming amount of things to understand before they even try a single tea which tends to paralyze them from purchasing.

Because they are sourced  differently and you get only information about the rough origin area and the elevation. And next year, when weather was different and the leaves oxidized a few minutes more or less, everything is slightly different again.

So, I´m not sure how this could work properly: on the one hand you want to throw stuff together to have enough data to get averaged opinions, on the other hand everyone is looking at more or less different products.

As soon as the pan contents start to boil, move pan to a cold burner until boiling stops. Return pan to hot burner briefly, just until it starts boiling again. Repeat this remove-return process 2 more times.

I understand this. Honestly, I always just assumed the POS system is just defaulting a tip.

One thing I will say in their favor:  they have an educational web site, http://www.teaclass.com, which is an excellent step-by-step intro that eventually goes into some more advanced topics.

198cqso,ki6veem,"I honestly haven't tried them but I'm happy to share something I learned in my 30 plus years of drinking loose leaf . Most brand name tea blends are ridiculously overpriced for the quality of tea you are getting. They are selling to suburbanites who want to be healthy and new agey who will happily plop down extra money for packaging, marketing and some hyperbole. If you dig a bit you can often find the grade of tea they use for ridiculously cheap by comparison. If they are using dried fruit, flower or herbs you can likewise source these in a higher quality for cheaper. TBH as I stated in the beginning I do not know if this applies directly to Adagio but  there's a good chance that it does. That said, no hate. Drink what you like and like what you drink. As for vendor rankings, they mean nothing in terms of quality and speak more to marketing effectiveness than anything else. Anyone who knows coffee well can tell you Starbucks burns their beans beyond recognition and really don't make good coffee but they aren't there to make good coffee. They exist to make money and they are good at that. Again, nothing wrong with liking Starbucks but there's a reason you won't find people fawning over them in coffee subs or forums. If Adagio sells tea you enjoy for a price you're happy with then don't worry about what anyone else says. That said, there's not much to discuss about tea bags for instance except which ones you like so they won't exactly generate a lot of discussion while something like a specific pu'erh there are all kinds of things to examine and compare between the ways different people may approach steeping it, storage, humidity so on and so forth so you'll see more discussion generated.",12,GullyGardener

[The Non-Judgemental Guide to Tea](http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/01/tea-for-everyone.html) is probably one of the best guides we've seen, and is highly recommended reading.

198cqso,kibxosj,"If you're speaking of single malt Scotch, then I agree. However, the vast majority of Scotch consumed worldwide is cheap blends. The last statistic I saw was that the single malt category only accounts for about 15% of total sales. In that sense, I don't think it's quite correct to say that Scotch is purely a hobbyist thing. I suppose that the range of tea consumption is wider, if only in the sense that far more people consume tea than consume Scotch. (I would guess, for example, that in the U.S. at least, the best selling tea is probably a bottled drink like Snapple or Arizona tea, which would suggest that people who drink things like Lipton tea bags are already a fairly narrow segment of the market). 

Still, I don't think any of this accounts for the differences in how these different segments interact with one another. I've read many posts on r/Scotch that talk about how good Cutty Sark Prohibition is for the price; and I've seen people review thousand dollar+ bottles. But I've never seen anyone complain about or look down on either type of discussion. Granted, in these discussions, people often disagree with one another, but in the several years I lurked there, I can't recall anything like the multiple posts I've seen here about ""snobbery."" There is, it seems, just something different about how the two cultures work. 

At any rate, my only point was that it is not really true, in my experience, that every hobbyist community has the sorts of dynamics we see in tea. The folks who want to get together to talk about Scotch don't seem to have any problem with those who love the lower end of the market, and those who love the lower end of the market don't seem to feel any need to militantly assert this against the ""snobs"" that look down on them.",1,menenius_agrippa

198f9au,ki6tfam,"Brewed Gong Fu style. 5 g tea to 50ish ml water at 212 F. Gaiwan, cha hai, cup warmed. Tea steamed. 5 seconds, 10 s, 15 s, 15 s, 20 s, 25 s, 30 s, 35 s, 45 s, 1 minute, 1.5 m, 2 m, 3 m, 5 m, 10 m

Steamed leaf aromas dominated by cooked apricots.

Apricots and floral notes on the nose with a touch of malt.
Apricots with a little charcoal on the palate to start.
Nice mellow lightly sweet apricot finish.
Mouthfeel was nice and silky.

At around the 9th infusion, nose was somewhat more rounded.

Aromas from empty cup included peaches and vanilla.

This is a tea that never really strays from its true nature as an apricot delivery system. If you’re looking for a tea that evolves significantly over a Gong Fu session, this is not it, however, if you’re looking for a tea that beautifully presents apricot notes throughout, this dancong has what you need.
Longevity was about average, which is too bad, because I could drink this all day.

Did 1st to last comparisons. 2nd infusion was refreshing brisk apricots, while second to last (penultimate) was rounded apricots and maybe some woodiness. 1st was apricots with a little dark chocolate, while last was very rounded showing that the leaves were done.

This tea was recommended to me by a dancong fanatic that I trust and this is why I trust their recommendations. They are so on the money.

The ""gold medal"" stuff is nothing you should take too seriously.

Oriental beauty isn't supposed to be roasted much, but you should still avoid heavily roasted tea too if you don't like the flavors you mentioned.  

Stick with green teas and/or lightly oxidized oolongs.  Unless you also don't like grassy/vegetal flavors...

You appear to be new to tea, so here are some resources to help get you started.  First, be sure to check out our sidebar, we have some useful stuff there.  There is a quick reference with the guidelines on what temperature water to use, and how long to steep your tea.

[The FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/wiki/faq) was put together to answer many of the questions you may have, including more detailed guides for brewing tea.

If you are looking for places to buy tea, we have [The User's Choice Vendor List](https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/wiki/vendors/page_01) which was voted on by the users here.

[The Non-Judgemental Guide to Tea](http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/01/tea-for-everyone.html) is probably one of the best guides we've seen, and is highly recommended reading.

If you're more interested in iced tea, [The Tea Lover's Way to Make the Best Cold Brew Iced Tea](http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/06/how-to-make-the-best-cold-brew-iced-tea.html) might be just what you're looking for.

Did you receive a tea gift that you are trying to identify?  If it is Chinese tea, check out ""[What is this tea I got from China?](https://theteafaq.wordpress.com/2016/11/17/what-is-this-tea-i-got-from-china/)""

I've checked the vendor list before. Frankly, it is hard to glean information from it... which may be part of the reason why these kinds of questions keep popping up in new posts over and over. The list contains several hundred vendors, with minimal information on each one. I saw Adagio recommended a few times for beginners in discussions, and seeing that it was ranked #8 out of several hundred options I thought it would be some elite tea vendor. Oops. I guess a ranking of #8 means that it is decently good at many things (and in this case, not great at anything)? I'm not sure how useful that kind of a number is. In contrast, at /r/telescopes there is a tremendously detailed guide for beginners on what kinds of telescopes to buy for different budgets and goals.

Overtones of floral grape.

197jx4k,ki45rzv,"Like everyone here already said ""better"" is subjective. The difference is probably in how it was made. If your jasmine tea is expensive  (20euro/100gr and up) chances are it was made in the traditional way, by letting the tea naturally absorb the scent from fresh Jasmin flowers, repeating this with new flowers until the desired aroma is there. This is labor and time intensive thus more expensive. I don't know if it is always rolled in pearls (anyone?), but as someone else said, it makes sense, in order to preserve the aromas. Less expensive jasmine tea is made by adding flavour directly to the tea. There can still be quality difference in terms of what tea it was added to and the flavouring used etc, but it's a different process than the traditional way. Taste wise, the traditional pearls have a much more delicate taste. Depending on what you are used to eat and drink, this might mean it just smells and tastes less.

(I emigrated 20 years ago and had never even heard the name until at least 2010.) Until at least the early 2000s, the national favorites were PG Tips, Tetley, Typhoo, etc.

Personally, not a massive fan of Yorkshire simply because it's super sensitive to overbrewing. Left for just a few minutes too long (a regular occurrence for me) and it tastes incredibly tannic, bitter and burnt. It also stains the everloving shit out of your tongue in a single cup, so don't be drinking it right before an interview or a date.

Don't buy it off Amazon in the US. I made that mistake with Yorkshire Gold. It's some made-for-export version packaged somewhere in the Middle East under the purview of Yorkshire Tea Australia or somesuch -- it tasted like a mix of ash and tar regardless of how it was brewed. Do not recommend.

Authentic English black tea that's readily available in the US? Tetley. 

It's been easy to find in supermarkets wherever I've lived/visited.

It might be in Yorkshire, but it is by no means the best selling tea in the UK (not that ""best selling"" is an indicator of quality but that's a different question). Typhoo and Tetley both outsell Yorkshire tea nationwide.

On the red / gold debate, a lot will depend on the water where you are. I find gold OK, but red is just not nice made with Scottish water. Have had it elsewhere and found it to be fine tho.

197q30o,ki2e6ft,"You'd do better to buy it from either an Asian market, or directly from Ito En or another vendor. Green tea goes stale very quickly, losing the fresh grassy taste. If you really want to use less plastic you'd do best to buy looseleaf. Decent sencha (which is probably what Ito En is using for that bottled tea) is also cheaper per cup if you buy it by the ounce rather than in bags. 

When brewing iced tea at home, be aware that you don't have access to the industrial sterilization process they use to preserve it, so you'll have to drink it within a few days before it starts growing mold.",4,YesWeHaveNoTomatoes
197q30o,ki2c3hi,"I also love cold Japanese green tea, and would drink it like water every day most days if I could. 

I don’t think you’ll find anything in American grocery stores; what you need is Japanese sencha, but Japan produces shit tons of sencha so it won’t necessarily be too expensive - cheaper than buying bottles for sure.  Somebody else can probably name a good vendor that sells decent sencha in bulk; I’ve only used one and it was on the expensive end. So find a good vendor of decent sencha, and then cold brew it. IMO overnight room temperature is better than fridge cold, but in any case it’s easy, set it at night strain it in morning, don’t worry about timing really. I find 3g leaf/200mL water is right; other people say more like 2 g/100mL, but that’ll cost you more so hopefully you’ll like it my way.",3,Nink

197q30o,ki3id27,"TLDR: cold brew tea of choice 10g/L overnight in the fridge, is good.  Toss after 3 or 4 days.

I think getting the flavor nailed down might be tricky but I have reasonable success with cold-brewing cheap  and expensive hojicha.oolong, silver needle, jasmine, sencha, lapsang, whatever.  Cold green tea is so amazing for sipping all day.  I may be addicted..

~ 10g per liter of water( or quart, basically the same) and pop it in the fridge for at least 8 hours.  Oolongs I'll even refill once.

 I chug this stuff but I'd perhaps be wary past three days.  Doesn't get particularly stronger but the leaves can get slimy and that might be sketchy.  That said, I have drank old cold brew more than once and never gotten sick.  Maybe it might taste little sour, like that Burmese fermented tea leaf salad.  Don't be me, I also eat things off the floor when the wife isn't looking. FYI It's not really great tasting by the way. I tossed it every time.  Don't think there's a secret last brewing technque to extract the soul of the tea.

Some teas benefit from a hot start if they come out a little bland with the first method.  This can go bitter though and my trick to control that is to prep the pitcher with 3/4 of the water and have it well chilled, brew the 10g with a quarter of the water and then add it to the pitcher after some set time.  Time sort of depends on the tea and or experience.  I just strain when I pour but if you have a chonky tea ball that works, they make giant ones for  steeping herbs for soup stock.  Or an actual iced tea pitcher with an integrated strainer.

Happy steeping.

197h07b,ki0z3sk,"I'm interested as well. What is your growing zone? Where did you get the plant?

I don't know about containers. One of my relatives has a tea farm in China. There are 3 general types of tea plants: Tall arbor type, Dwarf bush type, and the in-betweener. I suppose you can technically Bonsai all 3 types in containers.

In addition, there are natural cultivars and modified asexual cultivars. The natural ones are more likely to flower and die because that's what an organism wants. To breed the next generation.

Most farms don't grow from seeds because the property of the plant will be unstable. Like if you grow apples from the seed of a Gala, it will not grow into Gala apple tree. Most farms use asexual cultivars in combination with grafting.

I think the fundamental problem is the genetics of your plant. Even tea farmers have trouble growing tea plants from seeds. It's the reason behind the tragedy of the death of Tie-Guan-Yin in the 80s and 90s, when farmers rip out old plants to grow young plants to increase yield, only to find they are unable to grow new ones, or new plants don't taste good.

Maybe it's not you. It's the plant.

If everything is fine, maybe you need to pick the leaves more often to prevent flowering. Like with basil. When it flowers, the plants send energy to the flowers and abandon the leaves.",6,Living_Wallaby_9966

While I love different herbal(and green/white teas sometimes) teas and drink it daily as a healthy, medicinal drink which also feels ritualistic with little meditation.
I have never dreamt about drinking it though. 🤷
It seems to help me with sleep(herbal ones, or theanine which is a substance found in green tea) a lot cause I don't like having lots of dreams, it can be very difficult if you have experienced traumatic experiences. I sometimes wake up in a full blown panic from it, and in really rough ones it can take a long while just to process the shocking horror I experienced at night. 

And sometimes it can leave me terrified, it feels like I was traumatized in my sleep - this doesn't help considering the previous traumas I have been recovering from slightly resurface if I dream about something related to the events I went through.

One thing that helps a lot against dreams is CBD tea but I only have it on the weekends.

I know that this sub is for the tea plant tea but...
If you like green tea, you really need to try like all herbal teas, you will be amazed when you realize that green/black/white tea is just one herb of quite many that are very beneficial and can used as a tea. The green tea is just the gateway to the even more(depending on what but most are very good for you) healthier herbal teas. 🙂

I have tried over 100 herbals/teas, there is quite a lot of options, tastes, different benefits and fits different purposes depending on which kind etc. There is a whole world to explore if you have only tried like mint, chamomile and green/black tea.

Tea can be a great evening ritual and you can make it as involved and expensive or as easy and cheap as you’d like.

To  get started with loose leaf you’ll need a way to heat water, something to get the tea leaves out of the infusing vessel and something to drink from. 

Most simple would be heating up water, pouring it into a mug and then putting your sleepy herbs into an infusing basket and then dunking that in the water. I don’t like the infusers that are small with large mesh as the tea leaves can’t really expand and the smaller bits escape.

You could also get a pot to brew your tea in. My local tea house owners say this [ForLife](https://www.forlifedesignusa.com/products/hospitality-stainless-steel-teapot-with-built-in-strainer-14-oz) pot is the one they use most often. 

How simple or involved you go can adjust based on your interest and how much you want to spend. 

For the actual “tea” you are drinking - please note that herbals are not technically tea. Some people get upset when folks mix up the names. What you are drinking is a tisane or herbal infusion. There are lots of great herbs for evening. Camomile is one of my favorites, and I sometimes grow it in my herb garden!  You could also check out health food stores or small pharmacies as some will have a bulk section where they will scoop some out of a big jar for you. You can learn about mixing them.

197azyu,khzpy0f,"You have to understand that companies like Harney & sons are quite far removed from the tea producers themselves, and they have no problem selling you the leftover bits that don't pass the grade. Those inferior leaves are then chopped up, roasted, and then sprayed with oils to cover up off-putting flavors. Chances are if the company isn't from a tea producing region or they're unwilling to give you basic info about the tea like region, elevation, cultivar, etc. they are likely ripping you off and don't really care about quality as much as profit margins.

Generally, coffee tends to spike faster and may come with a crash, matcha tends to linger longer without the same peak or valley. This may not apply to you at all, though.

Im coming from a long history of drinking sweet/iced tea from various places. So tea without loads of sugar is a little different for me.",5,PeacePrestigious873
196mrie,khxwk71,"I'm brewing it gong-fu style - I bought myself a gai wan off Amazon as a first go as I didn't want to invest too much before I knew if I'd enjoy the tea. Up until now I just drank coffee, because I didn't like the usual teas here - PG Tips etc.  


I warmed my gai wan and other bits that are standing in for gong da bei etc and I played around with varied steep time, cooler water etc. I may need to get a water filter though as our tap water is very hard. The flavour was pleasant, but a bit weak for the second steep, getting better as the tea opened up, with an elusive floral / fruity taste. 

The others I got were Bai Hao Yin Zhen Silver Needle,  Jin Jun Mei, Lapsang Souchong, Mei Zhan, Purple Beauty raw Pu'erh and the Yue Guan Bai I mentioned from a site called TeaLyra?. The reviews were mixed, but overall positive.",4,Mountain_Finding_807
196mrie,khy39rx,"What first got me genuinely interested in higher quality loose leaf tea was trying a variety of anxi oolongs. The floral aromas that are common with that style are very approachable as a beginner (imo) and you can get decent tea for a comparatively affordable price. Regular western tea shops often carry very low quality versions of that type of tea which is probably wise to avoid, but with that said you dont have to dive right into the section of the market with more information heavy prerequisites to find decent green ball rolled oolongs. Cultivars like si ji chun produce a reasonably floral oolong tea while still being so industrialized that they are available at decent prices from semispecialized vendors.

One mistake that I made was to start my online shopping journey with sorting for ""best selling"" on Yunnan Sourcing and similar sites. That approach does not necessarily work very well with sites that carry thousands of different teas - I would advise to be somewhat diligent in your research before buying from there. Look around on tea subreddits/discords and see what other people recommend from those sites and if it seems to line up with your preferences before ordering. None of which is to say that places like that dont have good tea - they definitely do. A good starting point for ones pu'er journey is to buy Yunnan Sourcings own brand productions - they especially carry young raw pu'er at very reasonable prices that I think serve as good starting points. Their Impression series, f.e., or if you want to try something slightly nicer with high drinkability in its non aged state I would recommend the Xi Niu Tang Pasha 2023.

Edit: should probably add that I am still a bit of a rookie if that helps you evaluate the above. Been drinking oolong teas for a handful of years, but only started my pu'er journey a bit more than a year ago.",6,Substantial_Long7043
196mrie,ki04i2x,"Oh absolutely get a water filter ASAP. My home has a built in water softener, but during Christmas I stayed at my girlfriend's parent's house where they had hard water and the difference in my tea was immense. After just a week of being there, the mineral buildup at the bottom of my kettle was significantly more than several months usage of my kettle at home. Aside from just the buildup, the taste of the tea was just not the same. I brought some really high quality longjing with me that I hadn't opened up, and that was unfortunately a mistake cause it just wasn't as good as it should've been.

So you've already got a nice selection of tea imo, but I'll say that if you're interested in trying more, Yunnansourcing is my go to. Their samplers are also the best way to figure out what you want more of and what you can live without. This is how I began my journey into Chinese tea and it worked out really well. I bought the joyous spring sampler, pu-erh, and oolong and found that my gut instinct that I'd prefer green and (less oxidized) oolongs to be true, so I then bought some more a few months later of individual teas and it's been great.

My favorites as a whole have been:

Premium AA Tie Guan Yin is my favorite tea as a whole I think. It didn't do much for me at first, yet I came back to it the next day, and the next day, and so on until I burnt through my limited supply

Honey Orchid Mi Lan Xiang Dan Cong oolong has one of the best aromas of any teas I've tried

Longjing I enjoy all the variants of it honestly

White Peony Bai Mu Dan my favorite white tea

Long Mei and Pine Needles for roasted, nutty green tea

I also got the jasmine green/white sampler which is great to have cause 1) Jasmine tea is always nice and 2) basically everyone likes Jasmine tea so it's easy to give to guests.

19786q0,ki0ldzx,"A friend of my wife gave her a piece of a pu-erh cake they brought back from China, with pictures of the wrapper and a request to identify it.  

It is a ripe Yiwu cake and says it is a gong ting (made of grade 1 small leaf).  However in the materials listing on the back it also says it is gu shu (old tree).  That seems contradictory to me, as old tree material is usually plucked as larger leaf - it would be prohibitively difficult to harvest only grade 1 tender leaf from mature trees, let alone old trees, so I was under the assumption gong ting was pretty much exclusively a plantation bush type of tea.  Certainly it doesn't seem to be a type of tea affordable to a casual tourist if old-tree gong ting is really a thing.

Indeed the cake looks like smaller leaf and plenty of more golden young leaf, but too large to be consistent with grade 1 (I'd say grade 3, perhaps 2).  

I'm thinking this is just a nice smaller-leaf spring cake, not gong ting and probably not gu shu.  Perhaps not even Yiwu.  Still it does taste nice.

196pc3r,khxe0y0,"I think the sub is having an identity crisis at the moment.  There’s the camp of tea snobs that want to talk about Taiwanese oolong varietals and what the REAL meaning behind the name “duck shit” who are kind of the evergreen power users imo, and the more casual camp of people who want to talk about herbal remedies and their favorite flavor from the grocery store (bigelow perfectly mint).  

Browsing posts here feels like I mixed two unrelated subs together, with people mostly avoiding the posts that aren’t aimed at their camp.  Every now and then though the camps collide and it’s always a dumpster fire.  The tea snobs feel like their only corner on the internet is getting run over with misinformation and garbage fluff posts while the casual group feels demeaned and degraded by a weird group of trolls who keep telling them they’re not drinking “real” tea, they’re drinking something called a “tinsane”.  There’s threads where people ask for recommendations on where to buy tea, and you’ll have one comment thread where people are arguing about target vs Whole Foods, and and another comment thread where people are arguing about W2T v whatcha v YS.  These are obviously two completely different discussions and it’s crazy that it’s in the same comment section.

Personally, I think the sub moderation should cater more to tea snobs.  People come here to learn more about tea, which, speaking from experience, is a surprisingly opaque topic full of misinformation that is very hard to dissect on your own.  There are a bunch of users here who genuinely have an insane amount of tea knowledge, which like I mentioned, is worth its weight in gold given how much misinformation is out there.  I do think the weird 4chan-esque shitpost language from a lot of the snobs (which I think comes from r/puer’s community tbh) should get toned down, but I think for a lot of tea experts, they get very exhausted and frustrated when people are just incessantly posting things that are completely false.  I think some more resources and post guidelines would help keep things more on topic, but at the end of the day it would require moderators to start drawing lines on what the sub is and isn’t.",42,ya_bebto

An example is somone new to tea coming here to learn about green tea. Some casual people may object but it is honest advice that bagged green tea won't be very good and that they should try loose leaf in an infuser. (I've tried to make green in a Gaiwan but it's does not turn out that well.)

At the same time though if some users here like bagged green tea they should also be able to discuss it without being bothered. In turn though they should not refer to people who suggest lose leaf green tea as snobs.

196k43f,khurqzv,"I brew with a fairly high leaf-to-water ratio. The space they take up when they’ve expanded pretty much loosely fills my cup if the water is going to have enough space to really get around them. 

I’ve used basket strainers and Kamjoves over the years. Currently, I just use a gaiwan. A basket strainer with fine holes does a great job of getting even tiny bits of leaf out of the liquor and does not need to be disassembled to clean. I find that suits my purpose better than a capsule, which doesn’t have enough space for the way I brew tea and requires some amount of fiddling. I probably won’t go back to Kamjoves. They do a good job, but I seem to break them every couple of years. I don’t like adding to the landfill. 

The gaiwan is currently reigning as my favorite since it is so easy to use and clean. Just pouring through the tilted lid typically strains well enough unless I have some smaller bits of leaf in there, like when I’m near the bottom of the package and have more broken bits, then I’ll just pour through a strainer if it bugs me. Usually it doesn’t.  It is the easiest to clean of all of them since there is no place for spent tea leaves to get caught on. Both the basket and the gaiwan also don’t take up a whole lot of room in the tea cabinet, unlike the Kamjove. One advantage to the basket strainer is that it does lend itself to making larger serving sizes than the gaiwan. A gaiwan over 200ml gets a bit unwieldy. With a basket strainer, you can make a big mug or a a couple hundred ml just as easily. Both the basket and gaiwan can handle the high leaf-to-water ratio used in gong fu but there’s no reason at all you can’t use a lower ratio like you see in the typical British/Western/European style brewing. The capsule or tea ball style infusers do not adapt so well the other way. That’s why my advice to someone starting out with loose leaf is typically for the basket strainer.

I like this style of infuser, plugging the top with some slightly-too-large silicone, because it stays secured, even if submerged, but is also easy to open. I've only had it open accidentally one time in over a year (happened yesterday, actually), I pulled it up a little too quickly/forcefully and some suction pulled the bottom off.

I like this *design* in *particular*, because the flower catches on the lip of your vessel, keeping the infuser up toward the top and easy to remove from the drink. Meanwhile, the stem is just long enough that I can use it to brew in my preferred 20oz thermos, and still leave like an inch to add milk (most infusers that can hang over the lip, assume you'll fill to the top).

I hate the ones with the vice grippers, because invariably some little bits of tea get caught between the lips, holding the infuser open and allowing some leaves to escape that way. I hate the ones where you have to kind of screw a top and bottom together (typically found on a little chain), because over time they get out of shape and don't hold together well (disgorging the leaves into your drink).

I can't use it too well with my thermos, but if brewing in a medium-to-large mug, I really enjoy this [""infusinator""](https://august.la/products/one-cup-infuser), because it provides ample room for leaves to blossom during brewing.",1,micahcowan

196us65,khx71v3,"Absolutely do not wash. When making black tea, the leaves are essentially juiced in a controlled way. That juice then dries on the leaves and redissolves in the first 20s or so when you brew it. If you rinse, you throw away that juice and the associated flavours, which can be quite sweet and fruity.

Try it yourself, make a mini brew with 7g/100mL equivalent of leaves and steep for 20s, then taste. Use like a 50mL vessel or something to reduce your leaf use. You'll see in that short, srong brew the flavour notes you're discarding. 

The only teas I rinse are aged loose leaf teas, as they can genuinely have dust etc on them. I also rinse very broken tea leaves to try and remove some of the smallest broken leaves, but it's not common for me to drink broken leaf tea.

I do think you can, in principle, rinse any tea besides black tea and steamed green teas (like sencha etc) though - if rinsing takes your fancy. I just think it's uniquely harmful to blacks and steamed greens, as they infuse so quickly",30,womerah

196us65,khy9nxd,"There are two reasons why this isn't a particularly good idea. 

1) Black tea is processed in a way where the leaves are rolled to break cell structures and allow oils to be released and oxidise, this means the extraction of these very aromatic compounds is much faster than tea varieties that haven't undergone this process. 

2) Breakfast tea is generally processed in a way which breaks up the tea leaves into fragments, massively increasing the surface area for extraction, as well as breaking up more of the cell structure and causing much faster extraction than normal. 

With these two things in mind, you aren't ""waking up"" the leaf in this case, you basically extracting a fair amount of desirable aromatics then discarding them. There is one popular youtuber who I would say is very guilty of encouraging things like rinses on black tea, and doing things like gongfu brewing on broken leaf Indian teas, but I would avoid doing this for a typically desirable outcome.

Why would I rinse tea:  mainly because tea is not washed at any stage. It's plucked/cut and then processed. I know the processing involves heat, steam but I feel better washing it. Sometimes on compressed tea or white tea, rinsing will also open up the leaves and you'll get more rounded earlier infusions.

196ys2u,khx8w55,"You probably are worrying you'll waste them, don't worry you won't. These are remarkably easy to brew. 

Assuming you're brewing gongfu style you'll want at least a 120ml gaiwan or pot. Rinse for 15 seconds in boiling water, pour the rinse and steam for a minute by leaving the lid on. You could give it a quick second rinse after. Try and pour down the side for these instead of into the Puer that is stuffed in the middle. These will open up the leaves.

Then continue by flash steeping these for at least 3 or 4 brews. You can pour into the tea directly to get thick dark soupy liqour or on the outside for lighter brews that will give you more steeps. As the colour lightens you can add 3-5 seconds for one or two steeps and then add 5 seconds for each subsequent brew. Once you hit 20s steep times, you may continue until the tea is exhausted with increasingly light brews or until you are finished.

If you wish to brew in a more standard fashion I would suggest getting a thick teapot if you have one, a teapot with candle warmer, or a regular stovetop pot. Place the tangerine in 500mls to 1liter of water. Preheat any teapot you use to ensure it stays warm. You'll want to brew for 7 minutes or until you get a thick dark liquor, hard to see through without a torch. This might be 15 minutes with 1L of water.

196fje6,khyfjcv,"Was also my first guess, but we probably have to suck the towel to know.",2,Asdfguy87
196fje6,khwourd,"Japanese (green) teas are steamed whereas Chinese teas are pan fired. 

The steaming of the leaves lets the tea keep it's distinct green color in terms of the unbrewed leaves, but especially in the color of the tea once brewed. A Japanese green tea (look up a cup of sencha if you want an example) when brewed gives an undeniably green liquid.

Chinese teas on the other hand usually undergo a process literally referred to as ""kill-green"" where the pan firing of the leaves removes the green color for the most part. You can still find Chinese teas which have visibly green leaves, but they absolutely lack the same shade as Japanese leaves. Once brewed, the difference becomes all the more clear as it'll typically give a pale yellow color.

The reason why steaming gives a different color than pan firing is because when making green tea, the leaves need to be heated to just around 150° F (66° C) to stop oxidation. The longer that it takes to reach this temperature, the more green the leaves are. Given that pan firing heats the leaves to the desired temperature faster than steaming, Japanese green teas are as a result much greener while Chinese green teas are more likely to be brown.

Someone answered this while I was writing my reply sorry for info overload but we're both saying the same thing",13,SHAMUUUUUUU
196fje6,khwna87,"Japanese greens are usually steamed immediately after picking so they end up taking on a very dark green colour as more chlorophyll remains in the leaves. Japanese sencha is almost always rolled into very fine needles as well, so the leaf shapes are pretty distinctive too.

Processing methods for Chinese greens are more varied, but they are often withered first and then pan fried, i.e. using dry heat. As a result they have comparatively lighter colours, ranging from very light green to jade green. The shape of the leaves vary widely and can look flattened, twisted, or rolled depending on the specific tea.

These are very broad distinctions however, and there are of course some exceptions.",8,visualogistics
196fje6,khxzr33,"As the other comments below explain you why, here is a fun little fact why there is so much more clorophyl in japanese tea then chinese tea.. Shadow.

Yeah, why not? There are ways to do it tastefully or even beautifully.

> I would never had spent so much money on the jars or shelves m, just to put a curtin over it.

Just because you've spent money on something doesn't mean it was the best thing for that purpose. A cabinet may have been better suited. I researched independently and spent $200 on a terrarium tank and some moss for pet frogs, but once I got the frogs and went into the rabbit hole talking to other frog owners I realized my terrarium was too small and the moss, although it looked nice, wasn't safe for these frogs. I replaced the setup to make it better.

I get the appeal that this has a look you may be going for, but in terms of practicality it isn't optimal. And this is the tea community, where we obsess over water temperatures, brew times, storage humidity, etc. Everything to make the tea flavor and aroma better and not so much the architectural aesthetic experience. 

 > they are never in the jars more than a month cuz it get turned over so frequently. And this picture was enhanced significantly because the house is so dark. I have 1 window in the area that’s under a huge maple tree. I can’t even have indoor plants cuz there’s no proper sunlight. There’s no issue. 

Even after 2 weeks one could notice a difference. And again, this is about a product that you're selling to customers, who may not (or should not) be willing to sacrifice even 5% in quality for no benefit to the customer.

> But I’d love to hear about different storage ideas if you have any. I may just add another shelf. Was scared it would look to squished together. You?

I think another shelf could work visually and wouldn't look too squished together, but I would recommend a cabinet, UV blocking containers, a curtain, or some other light blocking solution.

I wish you all the best and if this works for you then stick with it, but in my opinion it isn't optimal for the tea drinking experience.",4,bouche_bag

Assuming you're in the US, you could try a few supermarket teas to start. These come in bags and are just dump in a cup, wait and drink. 90 percent of these just dump in a 350ml mug for 3mins or 2mins for a 250ml teacup of boiling water and drink.

You might be able to find loose leaf tea at a supermarket. These require something to strain the leaves out of your cup, or a teapot. I wouldn't go for these as they probably aren't any good for the increased price. If you want to explore that eventually, I would suggest a tea store. I hear Harney and Sons repeated often as a US store. You would be able to get some basic teaware and some basic teas there. 

I'd suggest supermarket bags as an introduction into certain flavours. Dirt cheap so you can buy a few brands and see if there's anything you like in them.

Most importantly, this is a hobby subreddit. If I went to the coffee sub posting and praising instant coffee, I wouldn't exactly be shocked, if people told me there's better stuff.

195xnl9,khr4kc8," I love tea. I’m primarily a bagged tea girl: had my first Lipton tea when I was about 6 or 7. Got a bad burn heating the mug of water on the rack in the microwave instead of on the bottom and the mug fell over. So like 1986 before rotating microwave dishes. We’d do two bags because of course. And sweet because absolutely. My ma and I drank tea together every weekend until I left for college and she died of cancer a couple years later. Stay with me, y’all. 

I joined this subreddit because I want to mix my own brews. I already do it with my bagged teas. I’ve got this Turmeric and ginger tea that I’m mixing with a Yogi honey chai turmeric whatever. Or my floral teas are steeping with my chamomiles and I’m tossing in cinnamon and honey… Since I’m already about high quality honey and flavor profiles and mixing and wanting a more satisfying sensory experience I’m gathering tools and teas to see what I want. I appreciate that I won’t be shamed for what I enjoy while also learning that there are better quality teas and methods. I just got a variable temperature kettle with an infuser so that I can get closer to the bespoke/experimental teas that I want to enjoy. I’m really just a lurker, but haven’t felt unwelcome. 

I can’t make what I want without various perspectives and methods. My feelings aren’t hurt reading that a tea I like is bland drivel compared to loose teas because I already suspect as much. I want to make excellent chai. I want teas that confuse my senses and meet practical needs as a singer but don’t make me gag like Throat Coat. But nobody’s going to pry a Yogi fortune from my hands. There’s levels of engagement to all of this—hell, I collect VINYL and handbags. I don’t have inexpensive hobbies lol I think some thicker skin, some shared enjoyment of tea, and more grace all around would make this less contentious. But, I mean, this IS Reddit. YMMV.

Similarly I find people on this sub pretty open to posts on a well brewed English tea, Moroccan tea or Indian Chai. I don't see people commenting that Gongfu tea is superior under such posts.

However there is a scale of sophistication within every tea culture, or for what matters, every kind of culture/hobby/art/craft. Supermarket teabags are at the bottom of the sophistication scale in any kind of tea culture. The best Chinese, English, Moroccan etc. tea are all loose leaves. People who get offended when good natured advice is given on why teabags generally give worse brews may be uncomfortable with the fact that the tea hobby can be a very sophisticated hobby. The loud minority that you speak of may probably be people who have always thought of tea as just a simple drink but find this depth of culture and enthusiasts on this sub and are just unable to accept that a scale of sophistication exists and their tastes are currently at the lower end of that scale.",13,jucheonsun

For instance, I live in a moderately rural area that's very close to a food desert. Anything beyond the most basic US grocery store staples are hard if not impossible to come by without ordering online, paying shipping, etc. I've started branching out, trying to buy higher quality teas online when I can, etc. But it's not always within my budget, especially since preparing lose leaf properly generally requires at least an infuser, strainer, or specialized cup. Whereas bagged tea can be made with any cup or pot one already happens to own. Yes, once you buy the specialized equipment you're good to go until/unless something happens to it and it has to be replaced. But it's still a necessary buy in cost that doesn't exist with bagged teas, which changes the financial viability for some people.

Edit to add: Yes. If you were to buy exactly the same quality of tea you're getting in a bag as loose leaf, it might conceivably be slightly cheaper without the packaging, branding, etc of the bags. But generally speaking, you're not. Loose leaf is typically a higher grade of tea, and the price is often therefore higher.

You can tell because of how much their attacks highlight their warped view, by saying something the lines of ""if you aren't drinking the ultimate single origin POO-ER 🤣🤣🤣 then you're a second class citizen!"", when ironically anyone with some basic knowledge of Puerh knows that a large number of the most sought after productions are blends.

Anyways, telling these people at all, even mildly, they could improve their tea experience contradicts and actively attacks their preconceived identity as a tea drinker, because it reality checks them. They have to confront that, in fact, they probably know extremely little about tea, except that it *probably* won't give the caffeine shakes like coffee does.

But that's just my opinion and basically making shit up, based on how I see these people type, my time as a heavy tumblr user (im in recovery), and partaking in certain secondlife/simulation game communties online.

The grading system you're referring to lets tea traders easily communicate the size and wholeness of a few types of mostly Indian black tea leaves. That's it. Again, I agree their wording was rude (and it seems the mod team agreed!), but the substance of their comments was correct. ""High grade"" doesn't mean ""high quality,"" unless your only metrics are the size and wholeness of the leaves, and you ignore the (majority of) tea styles that fall outside that grading system. 

As for the claim that my describing Upton as mediocre is just an opinion, based on my personal dislike for the styles they sell: no. I'm sorry, but their tea is objectively overpriced for the quality. 

Compare this [Upton Gyokuro](https://www.uptontea.com/japanese-green-tea/japanese-loose-leaf-green-tea/p/V00216/) to the same style from [Thes du Japon,](https://www.thes-du-japon.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=1522&language=en) a respected Japanese tea vendor. Thes du Japon lists the harvest date, cultivar, shading time, and specific region of origin. Upton, on the other hand, doesn't even list the harvest *year.* That's a huge red flag. And comparing the pictures, Thes du Japon's is much greener, the leaves are more tightly rolled—it simply looks more like gyokuro should. The Thes du Japon gyokuro is, by any conceivable metric, an objectively better/higher quality tea. It's also cheaper. It costs $0.22 per gram, whereas Upton's is $0.37 per gram. 

Let's do another. Compare Upton's [Nilgiri Frost black tea,](https://www.uptontea.com/nilgiri/loose-leaf-nilgiri-black-tea/p/V00879/) at $0.43 per gram, to [Ketlee's,](https://www.ketlee.in/product-page/nilgiri-winter-frost-black) for $0.24 per gram. Same style, same region. Notice how the Ketlee tea's color and rolling look consistent, while Upton's isn't at all? Upton's looks sloppy and poorly made in comparison, and it's almost twice as expensive! This isn't my opinion, and it has nothing to do with my personal preferences. Upton's teas are both worse and more expensive than their competition.

Lastly, I don't understand how trying to help people spend their money wisely is ""disrespectful nonsense."" I haven't been rude. I haven't insulted you.

It is entirely up to you in whether you agree with them or not, but their input on this doesn’t make them automatically a rude snob.

Also, if you haven’t tried it yourself on how they’ve suggested…why not just give it a try and see what all the rage is about? Maybe they are on to something? Or maybe not…you might try it and completely disagree. But the entire point of the input is to be helpful and open up people’s horizons to something they might otherwise have been completely unaware of (this is my own experience here). 

You see, I see a response saying “bagged or even flavored tea is lower quality” or “Chinese tea is better” and I say to myself…. “oh that’s interesting…I wonder why they feel this way and maybe I’ll research, give it a try and see if they have a point”.

Maybe you've never been poor enough to have to make those kinds of financial decisions. That's great. But I have. I still liked tea. I still found it lovely and soothing, and it was a bright spot in my day that I was interested to learn more about. I would still go to the store and see all the different brands and types and wonder about what they were all like, could I get more out of what little I could afford to spend by switching brands or blends, could I doctor it differently or change something about how I made it that would make it better within the confines of what I could afford, etc etc. If I'd known a place like this sub existed then, I might've come searching those sorts of answers. I wasn't disinterested at all.  I was still ""a tea person"". I was just poor, which has a way of impacting everything else in your life and how you engage with your interests.

I'm fortunate not to be in such dire straits now, and as a result I've been able to branch out more. Which is part of what led me to this subreddit. And it's been interesting learning more about different brewinh methods, etc from more experienced people, etc.

But your response is *exactly* what I'm talking about when I personally say that being here can be intimidating and othering. You straight up said that you doubted anyone chose bagged teas over loose leaf for financial reasons, despite the fact that I'd already basically said that I had done exactly that in the past in the comment you were responding to (just less explicitly than the way I've laid it out here). I shared my own personal experience and the perspective it brought me, and you basically said ""No, no. No one does that. Those people just don't care enough because they're more worried about convenience.""

Do you not see how rude and invalidating that is? To be told - essentially - no, you didn't really experience events the way you actually did. You weren't really concerned about the things you were concerned about. Because ""nobody"" does that? People who made the choice you made (buying bagged tea) are just guilty of being more concerned about convenience than anything else. Which sounds perilously close to ""only lazy people used tea bags"", btw, which is also condescending.

Maybe you didn't intend it that way. If not, that's great. But that's how it comes across. So maybe, if that wasn't your intention, consider how you word things next time. Because it does matter. And it can impact how welcome someone feels in this space.

195xnl9,khvcr7u,"Ok, well why can’t people give advice on this in a Reddit devoted to it? I get if someone is being truly rude, but often this isn’t really the case and certainly wasn’t the case above. It’s just someone politely disagreeing and providing their own input based on their own experiences. But then people like OP and yourself take issue when there is even the slightest disagreement or pushback (to the point you are ready to rage quit a sub presumably)…there is like this weird expectation or something that just anybody and everyone should agree automatically with whatever you say or they are the ones that are the problem. I’m sorry but no, I’m not buying they are the problem here. Absent someone being truly rude about it (and not saying this never happens), it makes no sense to attack people as snobs who are only just pointing things out as they see it. What’s the point of even being in any enthusiast community if you aren’t attempting or willing to learn from various people that may have been experimenting for a long time and may have their own valuable input that…god forbid…might make your own experiences and cost savings better? Especially with something as objective and measurable as cost which was the cited main concern. I come to places like this specifically so I can be exposed to other enthusiasts who may have input that I can’t really get elsewhere given it is so niche. There are vendors and sources of tea I would have NEVER known about but for this very place and advice. It expanded my horizons greatly on this subject.

I'm not saying it's all great, I said they have some things that are good, and that means good for what they are-- say an English breakfast blend, or an East Frisian blend, which is not offered at all by Ketlee's. That's different from ""objectively bad"" especially if it tastes good to someone who wants that style. To dismiss out-of hand everything they offer to people who specifically want that style is telling them that they are wrong to like it and that is rather rude.

195xnl9,khvzpl4,"I think you are underestimating how cheap an infuser can be. If you can afford $5 worth of tea on a regular basis, you can certainly afford an infuser. It’s also just a one time cost. Also, loose leaf comes in greater quantity. A big thing that makes bagged tea more expensive is also the amount you get for what you pay for. You get much much less quantity. You may FEEL like you are paying less with the bags when you purchase, but you have to replace your stock much sooner if you want to keep drinking…which results in much higher overall cost. A purchase of Loose leaf will last you way longer and for a lower price if you do it right (outside expensive brands) If you prefer bagged tea, that’s something different and OK…but in terms of total cost savings, you would a lot of times actually spend less on loose leaf overall if you are trying to budget. You are just objectively paying more overall for the same tea than you have to with bags…and if money is scarce, then it is making that scarcity worse not better. Finally, if someone is really struggling with money and still wants to enjoy tea economically somehow, advice on this is absolutely crucial and invaluable input to consider. This advice is literally there only to help them. It is truly baffling why some people get so offended and defensive when there is a  suggestion that there be a real avenue available to them to spend way less money and for what a lot consider higher quality as well lol especially when they ask for the advice.

There are much better sources even for Indian tea. Grade is not a mark of quality, it is a mark of sizing. If it was a mark of quality you would only get the tippy buds and no lower leaf in your tea, as they are the smallest highest and most flowery leaf. While all bud exists, much higher grade tea exists for higher prices because there are so many more factors in the actual quality of a leaf.

Processing matters, the consistency of the roll, colour and how it's been processed are incredibly important in judging leaf. Something may be graded at a particular size but has poor qc on shipping, leaving you with leaf that extracts as if a lower grade. Mineral content and soil, location, and more matter.

You can either adjust infusion time or water temperature to moderate infusion strength and very often using shorter steeping times is more positive than using cooler water.  I'm referring to Gongfu brewing, mostly; it just doesn't work out the same for Western brewing.  If you are putting a teaspoon of leaves into a cup of hot water adjusting temperature to 80 to 90 C for different types actually works best.  Green tea just needs to be brewed using even cooler water, although some people claim otherwise, and still use boiling point water for Gongfu brewing some of that range.

I guess it could work to extend that, saying that experimenting with Gongfu brewing might be best, to see how it all works out, and then get the best out of different versions.

In this case, the tea leave shapes are small and pebble like, so they got this cute name. However, when I googled the term, I did find some site claiming this is really just a marketing gimmick to create a new product to promote sales. The marketing slogan is “I’d rather have 1 cup of loose silver than 10 cups of pu’er”. The reason the leaves are in bits is because they are leftover of pu’er’s roasting process, where pectin of the leaves is stuck together with small pieces of leaves. They were considered production waste before, and now revamped as a cool new thing with many health benefits and more intense flavor. It sounds to me that this could go either way.

A hybrid suggests some genetic component when it's probably the same leaves processed differently.

Orange Pekoe is not a very specific name for a tea. Different brands will blend a variety of teas to achieve the balance they want between floral flavours, acidity, sweetness etc and it's likely the specific brand or farm that produces your OP is more florally inclined.",1,zhongcha

Black - blacks are very tannic in nature - I would brew slightly stronger than you would for drinking plain, and pear with sweet fruits that are punchy in their taste. Strawberry comes to mind. No mineral tasting fruits like rock melon, and they must have strong tastes and smell, so watermelon for example is out.

Dark tea - don't pair dark tea with fruits. Shou puer is nearly milky in its taste sometimes, with the oils in the tea. It's much too dark of a flavour to pair.

I've bought sencha from Harney and Sons and Yunomi. Harney Sencha was my introduction to sencha and generally tea as a whole. They have some nice stuff, but it's not the best price and some is drastically overpriced relative to what you can get elsewhere. Yunomi on the other hand specializes in Japanese green tea but shipping is so expensive. I paid about $50 alone in shipping and though I'm happy with all the sencha I've got, there's no way I'm trying anything besides Chikiriya for sencha on my next big order.

195zb8a,khrodbo," When I brew shanlinxi in my Gaiwan I usually brew starting around 195F.  Standard 5g/100ml, I just go with a handful, sometimes 7 sometimes 4.  Quick 5s rinse followed by 10s first steep.  With mine i get good flavor with two or three short steps, say , 5-10-20s, then with boiling water maybe a 10 and 20  s steep.

But 30 seconds?  Pushing it IMHO.  If I forget tea on the counter and overstep, like someone else suggested, you could probably dilute it and see if still palatable.  Feels bad to mess it up but it happens sometimes. Depends on the tea but some of my higher grade oolongs are more forgiving.  By higher grade  I mean fewer large leaves.  Bud and 1 small leaf is up there, once you get to two or three leaves you have to watch time and temp since in my experience larger leaves tend to be touchy with releasing bitterness.",2,Hazmatspicyporkbuns

Oh you're asking about other teas. Lol.  

I think theres some significantly variable flavor even in the same type of tea.  My big thing is dong ding oolongs and even there some, if I didn't have it written on the bags, could confuse for a roasty Alishan oolong.

Recently I received some gift teas from my mom via Taiwanese family.  The Da Yu Ling  (1800m) and QingChunMing (1200m) are most reminiscent of shanlinxi oolong.  I *think* they're all that qingxin varietal which might be part of the similarity.  The  Qingming is a popular expensive tea because it's in the name, they harvest it at what I translate as the eve of spring.  It is the first bud and baby leaf the plants push out.   I don't know much about it though.  Qing ming can also be generically any first flush tea.  

The DaYuLing can also come from much higher, maybe 2500m my mom says.  Those teas grow more slowly because of the cold but get more flavor from the bright light.  I've never had any first flush tea from 2500m but if you wanted premium that might be up there. 

Had to check some pricing, about 75c a gram for what's available right now which looks to be winter-spring 2023.   If you wait a couple months the new stuff should be hitting the market and fresh winter tea is, as the kids say, fire no cap on God on God.",1,Hazmatspicyporkbuns

If that’s the case it could be older tea and some of the packs are better sealed than others so some are less stale than others?

At the end of the day, Mighty Leaf is a pretty big brand that is buying bulk broken leaf tea of not amazing (but not terrible) quality and  blending it to try to achieve a consistent product. I think their Organic Breakfast tea is just fine and am happy to drink it when it’s what I get at a coffee shop / restaurant in the US, but if I’m buying tea to brew at home, I will buy whole leaf tea that is a similar price or even cheaper for a notably higher quality. If you want to go down that route, you can start with something like Stash whole leaf tea which is easy to get, fairly priced, and of very fair quality (a lot better than their bagged teas), or you could go with one of the popular US vendors like Rishi, Teavivre, Tealyra, [Yunnansourcing.us](http://yunnansourcing.us), etc. If you want to stick with bagged tea, have you tried Numi?

FWIW, Jesse's videos were one of my first introductions to tea, along with Harney and Sons, and I am not ashamed. I still buy the Harney Soba and Decaf Vanilla Comoro because I like them.

I've got $200+ teapots in my collection and yet my most used piece of teaware is a plain white gaiwan like the one in that set.

I know it seems accessible to a lot of us, but that's not the case for most people. Most people don't want to seem stupid or make a mistake and are eager for someone like Jesse to give them some guidance. As far as his prices go, buying something cheap and selling it for more is how business works. In fact, if you ask the Dutch East India company, they'll tell you that's been the business model for tea from day one. In terms of prices, he's charging what people will pay. Not a penny more or a penny less. If no one was buying his stuff, he'd reduce his margins. But it's selling out, so there's absolutely no incentive for him to charge less. Also he's being paid for his time and video production, or what you would call ""marketing"" in the business world. He spends time making videos, traveling, answering questions on his pages. All of that is legitimate labor and he should be compensated for it. If he's getting more people into different kids of tea, and getting them excited and wanting to try something more interesting and higher quality than a box of Yamamotoyama then I think he's doing something great.

While I've never bought anything from him, I personally don't think it's necessarily too bad that he's including a markup on his tea as he has curated his selection and made it available to a wider audience (this adds a very subjective amount of value to the product). And for the same reason don't beat yourself up about buying his products.

Sure some are quick ship over priced cleanly stored drop ships. Some vendors have “rare” tea that are slightly musty dusty (maybe a little crusty) but reasonably priced. Some are a company from China that has fine tea but definitely has promoters posing as random commenters in the tea subs. It’s all good, try the tea, don’t spend too much any one until you know you like the tea.

I mean the guy is selling ""ancient tree Qianjiazhai"" tea resin. That's like a coffee company claiming to sell Ethiopian Gesha as instant coffee—for barely more money than grocery store brands. It's a preposterous claim that reveals he either has no understanding or the tea industry, or he's knowingly lying. And that's just one example. I'd give more, but someone the other day noticed he surreptitiously [changed a product listing after they called him out for lying about it.](https://old.reddit.com/r/GongFuTea/comments/18xbtia/jesses_tea_house/kg9e5n5/) I'd prefer not to help him improve his scamming by telling him what to fix. 

I also don't really agree with your fountain pen analogy. Jesse isn't targeting the casual Barnes and Noble crowd; his audience is people who *want* to learn about tea. A better analogy would be if he created a Tiktok account called ""yourpenguy;"" pitched it as ""education"" about fountain pens and fountain pen culture; then sold the fancy looking, less functional journals as if they were enthusiast-level gems. And that's not even considering the, let's say, cultural insensitivity of a white Tiktok influencer profiting off ""teaching"" people about Chinese traditions he clearly doesn't understand. 

As I said in my other comment, I don't blame beginners for falling for his antics, but I don't see why experienced tea drinkers should act like what he's doing is in any way okay.

Nothing he's doing is slimy or unethical.  The BBB wouldn't consider any of your claims to be worth investigating.  He is selling exactly what he advertises.  Now, you can say ""he's selling shit tea and calling it high quality.""  If we're going to investigate every company that does that, then Hermes and FP Journe will be the only companies left standing.

And what you call ""customer's ignorance"" is nothing more than arbitrage.  Which is the practice of taking advantage of price discrepancies between two markets.  It is the driving force behind all global trade. 

In this case the price difference between the Chinese low end tea market and the American mainstream tea market.  People in China would never pay his prices because they are presented with easy access to higher quality at the same price.  They live in an efficient market.  But in America, the the access to higher quality tea is limited, so you have an opportunity for profit.   There is no ethical quandary about this.  He is taking a cheap product from one place and selling it for more in another.  And much like food in an airport, if you don't see the value, customers are not required to buy it. 

The idea that he should lower his prices to match his Chinese suppliers as a ""good business practice"" is exactly the opposite of a good business practice.  The free market determines the price of his tea.  

However, it's not all bad. If you believe that people want and will pay for higher quality tea at the same price point, then you have found yourself a business opportunity. 

Now is the time to open your own tea business and social media presence.  Clearly you care about tea, you want people to have access to tea, and you want lower profit margins.  So start your business! It cannot fail.

According to every single economic law, since you will be selling a higher quality product at the same price point, you will push Jesse out the market for good or at the very least force him to lower his profit margins.  Not only would be able to make money, you'd bring higher quality tea to the west and you would destroy Jesse and his business in the process!  It's a win for everyone.

Also perhaps if you actually attempted to launch this business you might have a better understanding of what it takes to run a small business and how our economy works.  But if you don't open the business, then your hate and criticism of Jesse would seem to be rather hollow.

Quite often cacao is just thrown on one big stack and when buying cacao it can come from anywhere.  Can try to buy organic, but that still comes from the same cacao pile. Just like with cotton or energy.

It is good chocolate though!  It also has implemented a supply chain tracker that actually traces their cacaobeans instead of buying from those giant random heaps of cacao.

Preset buttons for the different brew types makes it fast yet again because theres no need to keep a cheat sheet around and adjust a dial. Fill with water, close lid, press the button and go. Pours really nice, doesn’t spill. Also doesn’t spill when its boiling because they engineered a splash guard inside the spout. Guage and light on the side that indicates water capacity.

Cons: the plug in base must be placed on a countertop preferably near a sink so if this is valuable real estate on your countertop it may add to clutter. During the brew cycle it does make the trademark “water boiling noise” off and on as it ramps up to temp but it will automatically stop making the noise when it reaches temp. I can’t think of any other cons it just does what you want fast and doesn’t spill boiling water everywhere so thats great.

Steeping time is not really an addition in this case, as 5 times 20 seconds steeping is not the same as a single steep for ~1.5 min. Oversteeping is rarely a case in gongfu brewing as certain compounds needs more time to dissolve than others (and different temperature).

Mixing all of the brews would be like taking a road trip without stopping - it's still all the work of driving yourself, but otherwise not far off from a train ride. 

While I do think tea is generally best brewed gongfu, it sounds like it might not fit your desires/needs. Some puerh stands up well to western or even grandpa style brewing, I've heard many people getting good results from shou puerh especially.

I should also mention that after my first cup or two of coffee in the morning, I switch to tea for the remainder of the day. I prefer black teas (probably because I’ve been a coffee drinker all of my life), so decaf blacks are a must there too. And you’ll find that most inexpensive decaf black teas also taste as bland as their decaf coffee equivalents. But a decent quality black decaf is just as good, or nearly so, in my opinion.

As far as switching to tea from coffee - I'm convinced drinking coffee destroys my taste buds when it comes to tea. For like months after I drink coffee regularly the nuance of many nice teas is completely lost on me. So - go cheap with the tea while you start out. After you're in the habit of it, experiment by spending a bit more on nicer bagged tea. If you decide to make it a hobby - go with a in mug strainer or cheap tea pot with built in/removable strainer and start playing with some loose leaf.

You are looking for a non green tea with low caffeine and that you can drink in the morning . 

Maybe you should give oolong a try.  Oolong is partly oxydated, in between green and black tea.

Among them Alishan oolong has very low caffeine, around 37 mg per cup versus  95 mg for a cup of coffee. 

Same goes for 4 Seasons oolong tea. 

Jasmine or osmanthus tea may also be a solution.

Chlorophyll is responsible for absorbing visible light and carotene/carotenoids are responsible for the blue and UV light. When shaded, the plant is forced to produce more chlorophyll to maximize its ability to collect sunlight, about 3x more than non shaded leaves. This gives Japanese green tea their signature dark vibrant green color. Carotene/carotenoids (also found in carrots) triple in quantity as well, however, when broken down during the drying/steaming process is responsible for the depth of flavor green tea has. This is an extremely summarized explanation of Japanese green tea, there are more nuances than I could possibly know.

Also it depends of the shop, some have a lot of newcomers still learning about tea. And you Can also find great independant tea shops :) 

As personal experience it's Amazing to work there because you can drink a lot of tea and have really high quality and mandatory formation.


To answer your question : not as fashionable as Kusmi, and more informed and specific than Mariage on origin teas (for example) and the teas are really good.

1. Boil water (about 75% of the final volume of chai you want) and add the tea and spices.
2. Simmer for 3-5 mins. If you're patient you can simmer the spices for 10 minutes, and add the tea in the final 3 minutes. This draws out more flavour from the spices, but isn't necessary.
3. You should have a dark and fragrant concentrate at this point. Add whole milk (about 50% of the final volume of chai you want), bring up to a boil and simmer until satisfied with taste, texture and colour.
4. Add sweetener as desired and strain into cup.
5. Adjust steps until you nail your recipe. I haven't tried plant-based milks in chai but in my experience they are quite watery so as an example you might want to reduce the initial amount of water used or simmer for longer at the end.

I get the psychological side to it, but I'd be very surprised if you didn't prefer proper chai made by yourself with fresh, whole spices over a pre-made spice mix or instant chai powder.

You have to start somewhere. And a tea like that can even be tasty (but strong) just simmered for a couple minutes on the stove. So different techniques can come later.

And I'm still enjoying that tea BTW. Surprisingly drinkable for the price.",12,IronCavalry

this doesn’t look like particularly high quality puerh so you may not be blown away by the flavor or get too many steeps out of it, but some can last for as many as 10/15 steeps. tea with this sort of flashy packaging tends to be sort of gimmicky, low grade stuff marketed as high quality to people who don’t know better. yes store in airtight container.

Thankfully that's not really the impression I get with his tea.

I would suggest getting a scale and a pu'er knife (or some type of sturdy instrument that you just use for tea to keep it clean.). It'll make it easy to remove chunks from the tong, and weighing it using the scale will help give you some consistency.

And yeah, that was my gateway into the world of good tea. I hope you enjoy yours.",2,IronCavalry
194fzov,khg3kxv,"would definitely recommend going to a reputable site like white2tea, bitterleaf, kuura, essence of tea, or farmerleaf and buying a wide variety of samples instead of buying a huge chunk of junk tea to gauge how much you like puerh. with samples, you can get a good understanding of what types of tea you like without committing to spending too much and being stuck with stuff you will never drink. if you try this tea and hate it, i wouldn’t be surprised, because there is a huge difference between poor and decent quality puerh, flavor-wise. don’t let this tea define the genre for you! 

[this](https://white2tea.com/collections/2019-white2tea-raw-puer/products/2019-dangerfield) is a tea i’d recommend to anyone looking to get into raw puerh, and [this](https://white2tea.com/collections/2020-ripe-puer-tea/products/2020-brown-sugar) is a good entry to ripe. be prepared to wait for shipping, but it’s worth it. that being said, if you do choose to order from that site don’t just try those two. go crazy with the 7g sample balls and really try out a bunch of different teas to experiment and expand your palate.",6,whiteteas

1958a1y,khm94pd,"So, kinda like what people said, you can find a good one for not much, at thrift shops etc. I saw someone also suggested bartering your talents for a kettle, and that might be a good idea. But, for what you might pay for a sewing project, you might spend the same amount as a good kettle. I know that there's a difference between a kettle and a pot, so if you're just looking for something to boil the water I can recommend you what I have. As for steeping, I steep mine in a giant thermos, so you can use whatever.  Having a kettle is nice, because there's so much more that I use mine for than just tea. I like mine because it seems to be larger than most I saw, and I like to make a lot at the start of the day, then the thermos keeps it warm.

They're both a little more expensive that you might like, and definitely more than what you'd see at a thrift store, but you know, if you enjoy tea, and the process of making it, treat yourself. If I could make one last recommendation, avoid getting something that's polished stainless steel.

With all teas the soil type is a key element in the tea's taste.  Villagers wanting to guard the uniqueness of their tea bushes told outsiders that the color and uniqueness of the soil in their village was due to copious amounts of duck shit and began to call the their Dan Cong ""duck shit aroma"".

Highly oxidized oolong ages nicely but lower oxidized ones usually not so much either way they benefit quite a lot from reroasting every 4 or so years I would personally drink them within the first 3 years or leave them untouched for long term aging (10 years+)

I find black teas to be preferable within 2-3 years after that I wouldn't age them if not in cake form as the pressing process traps some of the moisture and allows it to age

It's quite extraordinary, the first couple of infusions tastes almost neutral after 3-5 minutes, more so than just tap water at the same temperature.

194lbqe,khgv3cm,"Brewed Gong Fu style. 4.5 g tea to 45ish ml water at 212 F. Gaiwan, cha hai, cup warmed. Tea steamed. 5 seconds, 10 s, 15 s, 20 s, 25 s, 30 s, 35 s, 40 s, 45 s, 50 s, 55 s, 1 minute, 1.5 m, 2 m, 3 m, 5 m, 10 m

Steamed leaves had aromas of rye crackers and plums.
Nose was reminiscent of lipstick and wax with something else underneath. That’s definitely different. It’s not unpleasant, but definitely not something I’ve encountered before in tea.

Palate matched the nose with some anise like sweetness. That sweetness flowed into the finish.
Silky thick mouthfeel. Very enjoyable.
Tea rounded over to have an interesting nature that was more anise and some flavor I couldn’t recognize.

Did 1st to last comparisons. 2nd infusion had that initial nose with additional note of fresh peas. 2nd to last was more rounded and no fresh peas note.
1st had even more pronounced fresh peas note, while last was more of the well rounded liquor like the 2nd to last.

I don’t know exactly what to make of this tea. It definitely had an enjoyable evolution and mouthfeel over the session, but there were definitely notes I couldn’t decipher. Like I’m missing a fruit or something in my mental aroma library.

That said many folks also enjoy green tea. My kindergarten class took a field trip to a cultural center where we participated in a green tea ceremony (although as a kindergartner I thought the tea tasted nasty and enjoyed the cookie that came with it far more). My mom liked to make genmaicha occasionally and that’s how I learned to appreciate tea in high school.

You can mimic most of the samovar experience by brewing a batch of tea extra-strong with LOTS of leaf, pouring a little in your cup and then diluting it to taste with water from the kettle.  However what you can't do this way is the slow simmer of the tea concentrate that would occur in the chainik on top of the samovar body -- with teas like Czar Nicholas II I have found that this simmering takes away most of the sharpness of the lower-grade leaf in these blends and makes the result much more pleasant.

193bffh,kh8or9p,"Tea (or coffee for that matter) won't burn in boiling water. You're just over extracting. Thats what causes the bitterness. Same with coffee. You can't burn the coffee or tea with just water. You can create bitter flavors in each more easily since higher temperatures increase extraction.

But the tea leaves will not burn.

The only way you can really burn them is if you keep them in water that is actively being boiled (such as over a stove) because you're introducing a lot more heat than you would if you just poured boiling water into a kettle and that heat will dissipate as steam that is above 212F and the tea is in contact with this steam. So unless you're exposing them to temperatures above 212F somehow, they won't burn.

193wlxp,khc6rfi,"Regardless of the tea you're drinking you can always reduce the time or the temperature.

Tea bags are designed for really quick infusion and as a result they can go bitter really quick.

Try with a cup of plain hot water.  If it's freshly boiled, let it sit for 30 seconds or a minute then dunk in the bag for 30 seconds and test a sip.  Use a spoon if it's too hot.   If it's not bitter, go for another 30 seconds and try again. In the end, count up all the time and you should have a good ballpark time to dial in. Don't be afraid to experiment.

Some cheap teas can also just be loaded with so many tannins that it is somewhat unavoidable.

You could also try cold brewing.  I do this sometimes.   You might miss out on some of the finer notes but hey it's bag tea,  I don't need to tell you to not to expect too much in the first place.  Same water to bag ratio to start and just chuck it in the fridge overnight.  Usually if I do this I make a big pitcher and then maybe you might want add an extra tea bag for every three or something.",11,Hazmatspicyporkbuns

But if you're not used to steeping your own tea and seem to only like it from tea houses and cafes...that's probably because they are using the appropriate (or at least *different*) water temperatures and steep times. 

If you don't have a kettle with temp controls, it can be pretty tricky to get it right.  Generally, white and green teas require the lowest temperature and shortest steep time. About 185° F for 1-2 minutes. Anything hotter/longer and your brew will likely be very bitter and the delicate tasting notes quite literally burnt off.

Oolongs can be steeped at 195° F for 2-3 minutes before becoming bitter. 

And black teas and herbals hold their integrity just fine in 200+° F for anywhere between 2-5 min depending on how strong you like your brew. 

Also keep in mind that not all teas are the same! You can have two black teas that seem in all respects the same to each other but are vastly different once brewed. Same for any type of tea. Even the generic stuff can be night and day to each other. 

I'd say your first step to steeping a tea you like is finding out what teas you've been being served. Maybe all the cafes have been serving you dancon oolongs but you keep buying taiguanyin oolongs. 

And lastly, don't worry about how you want to doctor up your tea to make it palatable. Cream, sugar, honey, spices....who cares. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Tea is a gift. It doesn't matter so much how it is enjoyed as long as it *is* enjoyed.",7,TeacupCat21

193wlxp,khc5jvl,"If you already tried steeping for less time next step is using same quantity of tea for more water(diluting it a bit), also avoid squeezing the tea bag, it helps to bring out the bitterness

While you might have some slight improvements I think it all comes down to the quality of the the tea, grocery store tea, even if brewed perfectly, still kinda sucks, If you want to start making good tea I suggest you visit your local tea store or look on the sub for some online vendors with a good reputation",6,el_conke

193wlxp,khcc0gd,"If you really want to get into the nitty gritty of it:

193wlxp,khud8oz,"I felt that way too when I switched from bagged to loose tea. I was like, 'what the heck am I supposed to do with this? Does it go right in the cup or...?'

Fortunately there's lots of different methods and vessels for brewing loose tea. The first time I saw a gaiwan I was *baffled* 

It sounds counterintuitive, but you can buy your tea loose leaf and put them in bags yourself. That way you have the ease and comfort of a familiar brewing method *and* the tea will generally be a higher quality than the pre-bagged stuff. The reason being that loose leaf is often synonymous with full leaf. As in, you are getting the full meal deal. Full leaf teas were the best of the harvest (whether or not it was a particularly *good* harvest remains a factor).

And then you have bagged teas. 
I'm sure you've noticed, bagged teas are often ground up leaves. This is where things can get a bit dicey. 
The leaves designated for bagged tea were not the best of the harvest. But that's okay, says the company, because it's going to get ground up; The customer will never *see* that the leaves were wilted, discolored, diseased or bug bitten. 

Okay. We can live with that. 

But then some companies will take it a step further. The waste from production is actually added back to the product to increase the yield. The companies that don't add the waste back will sometimes add some other filler for the same reason. It's a very efficient and cost affective system for the business, but not ideal for the consumer.",2,TeacupCat21
193wlxp,khu81nc,"Haha I don't think you need to do all that to make a decent cuppa. I worked in tea service/retail/wholesale for a number of years and even I don't do all that.

You could try filtered bottled water, but unless you're on a well or your water is being filtered through polluted pipes, tap water is just fine and you'll probably never notice a difference. 

My top recommendation for you is just to try a lot of different tea types in their different forms (loose vs bagged vs hot-steeped vs cold-steeped, etc) from different companies. Follow the guidelines for brewing and adjust to taste. Add cream and sugar, or don't. Pair with tea snacks, or don't! Drink it whenever you want, and don't when you don't. 

Lastly, don't let tea snobs get in your head (you will eventually encounter them on your tea journey. It is canon tea lore). They just love to tell people how they are doing tea wrong. But there is no 'wrong' if you are enjoying the results! (Yes, there are objective wrongs, but we are speaking subjectively here). 

Bagged tea from the grocery store is fine. Sometimes it's all that's available to us. Though it sounds like maybe you're not vibing with bagged tea (also valid). 

Adding sweeteners and flavorings to your tea is fine. But do give your tea a chance to wow you in its purest form. 

Heck, *burn* your brew, if that's how you like it (I do!). It literally does not matter as long as it's something you enjoy. Yes, the tea snobs can teach you a lot about tea and often they are objectively correct, but the way they impart that information is so needlessly condescending it really takes the fun out of it sometimes. 

So just try everything! Keep experimenting and asking questions and educating yourself.

Narrow your search by deciding what type of tea you generally prefer:
White, green, oolong, black, puerh, herbal?

Then broaden your options again by researching the different variations of that type. What's the difference between a dancong oolong and a taiguanyin oolong? Or Assam vs Ceylon? 

Ask for recommendations, and try them! Help people help you by being specific about what you like and don't like, and why. If you know you hate anything smokey, no one is going to recommend a lapsang souchong.",2,TeacupCat21

Their café often has several hours of wait time (main branch in Uji that is, they also have smaller cafés in Tokyo and Kyoto) but they have a nice selection of tea types in their store and often freshly brewed teas to try. I personally love their Houjicha, but every Japanese person I have served their Genmaicha talked endlessly about how good that one was. 

Ippodo is Kyoto's most famous old tea store and somewhere a lot of Japanese people go to buy fancy gifts for family. Their historical main store was just renovated (it re-opened in December), so it's definitely worth a visit but unfortunately also likely crowded. 

Fukujuen is another favourite of mine! Both their Sencha and 緑茶 (lit. green tea, used for any ungraded green teas) were of surprisingly high quality. Fukujuen also has the best English language website and they advertise tea experiences specifically for foreigners, so if you are unsure where to start, that one would be my recommendation. Fukujuen also has their main branch in Kyoto but they have stores all over the country. The flagship store also sells a lot of tea wares, not sure about the other branches.

Traditional tea stores in Japan don't really sell black tea. Lupicia is a Hokkaido shop specialised in ""Western"" teas, which mostly means lots of flavoured black teas, some Oolongs and a few hand selected Uji-chas. They do however, also have a large selection of unflavoured teas, especially when new harvests come in and they have a variety of cute tea tins for collecting. The store in Kyoto (Teramachi-dori) is bigger than the stores in Osaka. Never been to one in Tokyo, so I can't say how those are. 
The biggest advantage of Lupicia is that they have open samples, so you can at least smell the teas. That's not always standard with tea shops in Japan.

As far as teas go:

グリンティー (literally the english word green tea) cheapest green tea, mixed with sugar, aimed at children. Be careful about asking for green teas in store, because they might think you are looking for this.

緑茶 (ryoku-cha, green tea) the Japanese word for green tea, usually used for ungraded green tea, because if it was something special they would write that instead. Cheap, daily-use tea that the average Japanese person drinks like water.

番茶 (Bancha) lower grade of green tea, similar to Sencha but cheaper.

煎茶 (Sencha) sencha, second most famous Japanese type of tea after matcha. theoretically, the main difference between matcha and sencha is that matcha get's turned into a powder. But the money is where the matcha is, so sencha tend to use slightly less high quality leaves. 

抹茶 (Matcha) powdered green tea. comes in a variety of grades/price ranges. You can totally make matcha latte out of high quality matcha but that's just throwing money out of the window. Milk masks a lot of the subtler flavour differences of high grade matcha, so get the cheap stuff from the supermarket for that.

玉露 (Gyokuro) highest grade of Japanese green tea. Said to be less bitter to mildly sweet but what different producers sell as Gyokuro varies wildly. If you buy one, see if you can order a cup to try at their store first to see if you like it, because it is usually capital E Expensive.

ほうじ茶/焙じ茶 (Houjicha, lit. roasted green tea) roasted green tea, popular for it's smokey flavour and lesser caffein content. Also sold in powdered form for lattes. While popular in Kyoto/Uji, it is probably the only tea famous in Japan for a different region. Kaga-Kuki-cha is a famous produce of the Ishikawa prefecture and quality label like Uji-cha.

(Uji-cha is any tea grown in Uji, Kyoto prefecture. It is said to be Japan's highest quality tea, so many advertise teas only as Uji-cha)

くき茶 (Kuki-cha, aka stem tea) Kuki-cha is any tea that uses stems instead of leaves. Theoretically all teas could be made as kuki-cha, but typically kuki-chas are a variety of houjicha. Houjicha already has low levels of caffein, but kuki-houjicha has even less. 

玄米茶 (Genmaicha, brown rice tea) usually a type of green tea (often sencha) mixed with roasted brown rice. Sometimes mixed with matcha powder, popular tea to serve with meals.

麦茶 (Mugicha, barley tea) typically made from only roasted barley, without any green tea in it. Often served cold on summer, popular at traditional noodles shops.

黒豆茶 (kuromamecha, black soybean tea) made from black soybeans. sometimes in pure form, sometimes soybeans get mixed in with green teas. Hokkaido is famous for kuromamecha. Beans are a symbol of longlevity in Japan, so you often see this tea pop up around new year. Also sold in powdered form, but the powdered one often has sugar mixed in.

昆布茶/こんぶ茶 (Kombu-cha, no not that one, lit. seaweed tea) Kombu-cha (sometimes wrongly written as Konbu-cha to differentiate it from the western fermented drink) is a tea made from seaweed. No really. Often flavoured with Japanese plums (ume), it basically tastes like soup. Good choice for Cha-tsuke, a dish where you poor tea over left-over rice. Basically nature's sport drink. It sounds funny but it's a favourite of mine. Grt a tiny powder pack at a supermarket and invite your friends and family over for a Japanese tea party!",58,DifficultDadProblems

cups, but enough that if I skipped a day I would feel it hard the next day. I switched back to tea during the early pandemic and it went smoothly. No caffeine headaches at all and now I could skip a couple of days and still not get a headache. 

Personally, I’m a loose leaf kinda gal (for the most part - I do enjoy a builder’s tea with milk and sugar). I find teabags too expensive for what you get. You can buy your own teabags to fill with looseleaf and it would still be cheaper than buying teabags direct.

The diuretic effect of the caffeine in coffee (and tea) does not offset the hydration it provides.

So, at least as it relates to daily hydration, feel free to drink whatever coffee or tea you want.

That being said, there are other reasons you may want to limit either, mainly due to your body's response to caffeine (and what would be safe intake on a daily basis), some of the more harsh properties some folks experience (like drinking green tea, some folks need to eat beforehand to reduce risk of upset stomach), or even teeth health (coffee particularly can cause staining and other issues with teeth if not paid attention to).

192rs1k,kh5961e,"Here are some possible reasons why coffee may be stronger:  
1. Brewing time.  
2. Amount of coffee beans.  
3. Water pressure or temperature.  
4. The concentration of active substances in the coffee liquid.  
However, since there have been no quantitative experiments, our discussion is based on certain assumptions. Typically, 15 grams of coffee beans are used to make a cup of coffee. Through high-temperature or high-pressure extraction, most of the active substances in the coffee powder are extracted into the coffee liquid.  
For the same amount of tea brewed in a covered bowl or purple clay pot, only 5 grams of tea leaves may be needed. Moreover, the brewing time should be shorter than that of making coffee, so it is possible that the active substances are extracted less. In addition, 5 grams of tea leaves can be brewed more times, so the active substance concentration in the tea may be lower. Active substances refer to caffeine and other substances that stimulate your nerves.  
Specifically, the active substance concentration of coffee is typically around 100 milligrams per 100 milliliters, while the active substance concentration of tea is generally about 20-30 milligrams per 100 milliliters. In other words, for the same amount of coffee and tea, the active substance concentration of coffee is typically around five times that of tea.",5,orientaleaf

What I’ve done at home is use fresh ginger and cracked cardamom pods and a few cracked pepper corns and cheap assam tea, and the bare minimum of water to make a very concentrated tea. Simmer it all for 5-10 minutes then add lots of milk and however much sugar at the end to taste.

Yiwu Mountain Tea also has a deeper selection, with cakes that already have a few years of age on them.

2. Much like tea, yerba maté can be processed and prepared in a variety of ways. What I drink is a variant of hot Argentinian mate cocido, using a french press for brewing though. I've arrived at the conclusion that I don't like smoked or roasted types of yerba maté. Even green, unsmoked produce is sensitive to water temperature; e.g., the chimarrão tastes like a spinach smoothie when not hot enough but very bitter when too hot.

3. Various blends are very popular: with herbs, fruits, bark from some trees, ... I'm a purist of sorts and resisted for a long time, but eventually gave in. I add lemon balm from my backyard to smooth things out and I love mint. I just had CBSé Guaraná this morning; when I manage to hit the sweet spot, it's a bit fruity from the guaraná as well as very minty.

In case of both you might use simmilar amount of leaves (5-6g/100ml will be very good, though of course you may use more for even more concentrated beverage, here shiboridashi works pretty well as it's often very small [I have one with 40ml] so it's easy to adjust the way you want it to be concentrated, thought in my opinion for standard sencha kyusu would be more suitable) you can use simmilar amount of leaves.  

In case of brewing temperature, in sencha I would reccomend anything between 60 and 80°C (typically the higher quality sencha will be suitable with lower temperatures), and in case of gyokuro  45-60.


In case of brewing, in case of sencha I'd recommend  trying out  first brewing for 1 minute, and in case of gyokuro I have at least two  methods of brewing to consider,   one would be  to   make a first brew using the water as above for two minutes.  The second one:  Let gyokuro sit in a room temperature water for 14 minutes. Give a try to both methods.

192brd1,khb58ps,"> biodiversity collapse and other ecological overshoots.

Fundamentally, the kind of soil depletion that Marx or today John Bellamy Foster are worried about in a capitalistic market economy are still at play here. In our case it is not nutrient depletion, but the soil itself literally going down hill.

 Sun (Picture 5), reminded me as we were plodding along this last week that his parents would always hoe from above and not below while making rows, and would carry the weeds, fallen sleeves, and even soil up the hill to higher plots.   
Stuff like that has kept these hillsides agriculturally viable for centuries. The original peasants like Sun who knew these practices are now mostly dead or unable to carry out that backbreaking labor.  We were able to do it on a tiny scale last Fall, but I am basically only working with youth volunteer labor and what I can do myself. 

Although it is the Chinese side co-op and the government that is helping us make all this happen, they are still thinking about those short term returns on investment. The co-op desperately needs to make money fast and pay off debts, while the government needs to demonstrate that this project was a good investment. To that end, they want to make a plantation that not only has a good yield, they want one that looks ""right."" That means nice straight rows regardless of terrain, uprooting everything within the desiginated project site, and even getting rid of some re-wilded tea bushes that could actually have a perfectly fine yield if we just cut them back. Why get rid of perfectly good tea bushes?  Because they are in the way, because they were planted messily, because some of them have that natural reddish tinge characteristic of older local varietals. 

From an ecological point of view, this entire project was irrational to begin with.  The plot of heirloom tea bushes we have up the hill can meet our production needs and is already a good example of organic management.  Yet, it has not persuaded neighboring farmers to stop spraying or using chemical fertilizer, and it certainly did not impress the local government. I am not sure if it is Capitalism or what, but there is this push to go big and make it look ""right.""",2,OneRiverTea
192yzd2,kh5s8vp,"Brewed Gong Fu style. 4.5 g tea to 45ish ml water at 212 F. Gaiwan, cha hai, cup warmed. Tea steamed. 5 seconds, 10 s, 15 s, 20 s, 25 s, 30 s, 35 s, 40 s, 45 s, 1 minute, 1.5 m, 2 m, 3 m, 5 m, 10 m

Steamed leaves had aromas of raspberries.
Maple syrup and malt on the nose with hints of stone fruits.
Malt and briskness on the palate.
Silky mouthfeel.
Apricots and cherries on the finish.

Fruit notes on palate took over as malt rounded over during the session, which was a nice evolution.

This tea’s flavors were definitely on the thin side of things which kept it from greatness.

Did 1st to last comparisons. 2nd infusion was very plum and raspberry on the nose, with dark chocolate on the palate, and that fruit finish, while 2nd to last was light nose, rounded palate, and light sweetness on the finish. 1st infusion was a lighter version of the 2nd, while last was almost out of gas.

I really feel like this tea was a near miss from being stellar. It had all the right flavors and evolution, it just wasn’t quite there in terms of overall presentation.

'Red Buffalo' (also from Chariteas). It's a rolled oolong from Vietnam that has a toasty/apricoty quality. It makes a *beautiful* amber colored brew. 

'Dark Forest' from the company Bitterleaf Teas. Unfortunately I don't think they will ever restock. Which is truly a shame because it was so good! It tasted like dark chocolate and deep red cherries.

193gtdq,khccmr5,I appreciate the insight on caffeine. Thanks!,1,Timely-Coat8212
193gtdq,khdyt1j,"I recommend you make some stocks. Here are a few recipes: 

Veggies:
Chop up carrots, celery, onion (leave those brown peels on), and toss in a large stock pot. Put every piece in, even the ""scraps"" you would throw away.  Add water to cover veggies and turn on medium heat. Once it starts simmering turn it down to low, cover and set a timer for 20 minutes. You'll have a rich, nutrient dense water you can drink as is or season with salt and other spices on a per cup basis. 

Meats - work best if you have an instant pot or other pressure cooker. The best part about meat stocks is they will be gelaton at room temperature so this acts to coat and heal the gut. 

Chicken. Get a rotisserie chicken or a whole chicken you've roasted. Enjoy the meat however you want. After peeling the meat from the chicken save the bones and cartilage. Add the entire leftover chicken bones, cover with just enough water to cover the bones. Add 1tbs of ACV or other vinegar (don't worry you won't taste it).  Cook on high in an instant pot for 1 hours. Stovetop bring to a boil for 20 minutes removing the bubbles with a skimming tool. Turn down to medium so it bubbles but isn't a roiling boil. Cover and simmer for 4 hours checking frequently to stir and add water if any bones are uncovered. 

Pork - buy some neck bones for $5 from the grocery store. Roast them in the oven at 400 for 20 mins. Like chicken add water and vinegar. Then cook in IP for 2 hours. Stovetop simmer for 8-12 hours. 

Beef - buy leg bones and roast like pork neck bones. Cover with water like other stocks.  Cook in IP for 4 hours. Stove top requires at least 12 but ideally 24 hours. I've never made a true beef stock on the stove to be honest. 


Refrigerated stocks will firm up to a gelaton like jello. You can use a spoon in this state to remove all the fat. The gelaton will last in the fridge around 5 days. You can easily divide mug sized servings and freeze them to last months. Stocks can be seasoned as your stomach can handle.",1,SeraphimSphynx

Honestly, just make Masala chai yourself. Decorticated cardamom, smashed fresh ginger, cloves, and black tea (Indian CTC is standard but can get tannic) boiled for 40 minutes, then add whole milk and simmer for another 15. Add sugar. Done. Do it in large batches and you've got energy drinks for the week.

192nl9x,kh51ib8,"Easing the transition from coffee to tea can be an adventure, filled with delightful discoveries. Here are few suggestions that might suit your palate, highlighting the depth of flavor and complexity, similar to that of coffee.   
\*\*1. Black Teas:\*\* A good place to start would be with robust black teas. They are full-bodied and carry a certain depth in flavor that could closely replicate the strong profile that many coffee drinkers enjoy. 'Assam' from India and 'Keemun' from China are particularly well-loved for their malty, rich flavors.   
\*\*2. Pu-erh Tea:\*\* Fermented and aged, the unique processing method of Pu-erh tea gives it a complexity and intensity of flavor that can compete with coffee. It has an earthy taste with a touch of bitterness and a sweet aftertaste.   
\*\*3. Lapsang Souchong:\*\* If you like your coffee dark and smoky, Lapsang Souchong's deep smoky flavor might appeal to you. This black tea from China is smoke-dried over pinewood fires which lends it a unique smoky flavor.   
\*\*4. Yerba Mate:\*\* Although it's technically a tisane (infusion), it's worth mentioning Yerba Mate here. It has a high caffeine content and a complex set of flavors, ranging from herbal to slightly bitter to sweet, which might make for an interesting switch for coffee drinkers.  
\*\*5. Matcha:\*\* For those who love the ritual of making espresso, matcha (a powdered green tea from Japan) could be an interesting substitute. It gives a nice caffeinated kick and possesses a creamy, umami flavor that's enjoyable.  
Finally, it's about your preference and exploring the fascinating world of tea. Remember, each tea type has many variants, and flavors can differ based on where the tea was grown, how it was processed, and how you brew it. Happy tea tasting!",7,QiQiFamily

192xtdw,kh6qe7g,"I agree that it seems a little too cheap to be good Gyokuro. For 20€/100g you can get really good Sencha which will be a better experience than bad Gyokuro.  

To still get something out of it, keep in mind:

- Adding more tea (to water ratio) intensifies the taste that you have. So if you had something that was nice but weak, just add more leaves next time.
- Based on your tests, it turns bitter quickly, so focus on tests with 50-60°C from now on. Hint: It is possible that your temperature measurement is not completely correct and that it reads lower than what it is. For example when your meat thermometer is just halfway submerged.
- Umami is not the same as bitterness. So if it really is very bitter, that´s not what it should be.
- Gyokuro can also be brewed like a Sencha. Gyokuro has just the advantage to work with even lower temperature and longer steeping time very well. So maybe try 60°C for a minute if you haven´t already (amount of leaf is not that important just for testing the bitterness, so go with like 5g for your cup).

The sweetness can be quite different between different qualities and cultivars, so maybe this one is just not for you (or even objectively bad). I´d recommend to try smaller samples of more expensive Gyokuro just to know how they can be.

192xtdw,kha0un2,"Great that you can enjoy what you have left of it!  
Cold brewing promotes the umami a lot, even with other Japanese teas. You can always try to ""tune"" teas in the direction you want. If it´s too much umami, reduce the steeping time a little. Or save it for when you really crave to taste something strong.

But I agree that a Sencha is more of an everyday tea. Try Kukicha (/Karigane) as well, you might like that and it´s relatively cheap.

You can find tons of good tea in Germany, and if you happen to live in / near a big city, maybe even in person. Berlin has some very good shops, but judging by your water hardness that´s far from you ;)

You can obviously get everything online, but some shops are a little obscure. For example this one here: I met him in person and this guy really knows what he is talking about - but marketing is probably not his strength.

192beuh,kh5uv09,"Yeah puer is an extremely broad category of tea and cheap shou tends to be very bland at best (fishy and metallic at worst). I love puer but it’s not really all that similar to a black tea. That said, if you want a tea with punch, puer is where you’ll get it. Lao Man E raw puer tends to be very very potent and bitter (word of warning, if you don’t like bitter things you’ll hate it). If you want something with some good oomph to it that’s not crazy bitter, check out something from Kuura. They tend to be nice and strong, although their marketing is certainly odd. 

As for actual black teas. If you’re willing to go somewhat expensive, Song Tea has two of my favorites. A Different 18 is a Taiwanese crossbreed of two cultivars that together produce a very distinctive herbal flavor, which is then roasted to give it a very thick sweetness. On the other hand, Shuixian Red tastes very very strongly of Mexican peanut candy and those dark cocktail cherries. It’s a very unique tea but it’s ludicrously expensive.

As for more affordable teas that are still great—Taiwan Tea Crafts has a good Red Jade that’s quite affordable, about $15/50g. Yunnan Sourcing also has the very dark and rich Mojun Fu Cha 1368 brick which is a very nice fu brick tea from Shaanxi, and a whopping 200g for $17. A real crowd pleaser that one, and you can brew it pretty heavily because it has very low astringency. If you’re looking for a very strong black tea, I’d also point you towards Yunnan black teas. Check out the Purple Voodoo from Yunnan Sourcing.

My reason for telling people to just use more coffee or tea is because it's the most intuitive thing for people who don't see these drinks as hobbies, and their idea of ""strong"" just means ""higher concentration and more bitter"".

There are 100s (literally) of tea dealers all over the place here (it's crazy just how many tea shops are literally on every street) ... the problem is I don't speak Chinese and there are 1000s of options ... I'm wondering if the brands you guys are buying are marketed specifically to a western audience and if they are even available here in China. I guess I could go into the tea shops and ask around ... they probably (surely) have similar options but it's just a lot harder with the language barrier and the thousands of different branded bings (also all in Chinese).,1,twbivens

-Pour boiling water and steep for 5 minutes

-Pour into teacup through strainer (always teacups and saucers, I’m not one for drinking from beakers)

As I said, tea production in india was a product of british colonialism. The chinese had been exporting tea before that, and it was already known in the west. Yes, it was made more available to the masses, but let's be honest - even though you can get it in every supermarket, tea is STILL a very niche topic. Most people have no idea what is is, how it is made, where it comes from, and use the term interchangebly with anything brewed from any plant.
Now people have been getting more into chinese tea, there are more specialized shops selling a variety of high quality leaves, sourced directly from farmers instead of wholesalers and all that stuff. Who and what do you think is responsible for that developement? It's globalization, but sure as hell not a result of british colonialism. It's mostly chinese immigrants, or descendants of those, as well as some passionate people who visit or move to china to learn about tea, who're trying to educate people about the culture and intricacies of tea production.",0,Potatow-Edge

Tea Forte has a reputation for their tea blending and I see why. I love Adagio Tea but I think Tea Forte is overall tastier if way more expensive. 

An 18 dollar loose leaf canister will make 35 to 50 cups so breaking it down by cup makes it very affordable luxury. These brands tho are for folks like me who love flavored Tea.

191utx0,kgz7pqn,"It can help to think about tea in price per grams, or price per serving (although that’s going to be the same ratio if you’re using a standard # grams per serving). You can reliably get good loose leaf tea for 30 - 50 cents per gram, which is around 90 cents to $1.50 per serving if you’re using 3 grams. 

Bagged tea should rarely, if never, touch those prices, and if they are then you’re being sold the marketing or the aesthetic. For example just a random pick from their website is 40 pyramid bags for $68 which is nearly 60 cents per serving. In my opinion that is really steep for bagged tea, especially for blended herbal tea. You can get a multitude of much better teas for the same price point. 

Beyond just tea though you’re being sold the experience of trying different flavors, the presentation, the information they include in the box etc, so in the end it’s up to you if it’s worth it. Is something like that a nice gift for someone who isn’t super deep into tea? Sure. For “hardcore” tea drinkers?

191x6ja,khaajae,"This probably doesn't help you much if you already have a preferred tea set/gaiwan you want to use, but I just got this lovely [""360 degree swiveling gaiwan"" travel set](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B096V2JKPP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) (which includes a tea tray) and am enjoying it.

Of course, while it arguably has a gaiwan-and-pitcher and is marketed as ""gongfu"", it's not suitable for serving multiple cups at once, gongfu-style. It's fine for serving a single person (which is how I typically use it), but since the ""gaiwan"" actually sits (and swivels) inside of the pitcher, with no barrier between them except a filter, functionally it's much more like a teapot than a traditional gaiwan (if I were serving for two, I would first pour into a second pitcher, and *then* pour into cups, the pitcher in the set certainly isn't for ""fairness""). If you don't normally use ""lazy""/automatic gaiwans, it also pours more slowly (via the pitcher) into a cup than you can pour a traditional gaiwan into a pitcher or cup, so you may have to adjust your steep time by the fact that the water will remain in contact with the leaves a tad longer as you are decanting.

Oh! And, since the water level is shared between the gaiwan and the pitcher it sits inside, I don't think it's useful for infusions of less than \~100mL at a time. I use it when I want larger portions of tea, and either use a non-gongfu teacup, or else I pour two cups and drink them both. :)",1,micahcowan

Citrus and malt on the nose.
Nice thick mouthfeel with a little astringency.
Orange on the finish with a touch of bitterness, almost made it like grapefruit.
Palate was more citrus and just a little bitterness to start.

Would be interesting to do head to head with this and Ketlee’s first flush Darjeeling.

Tea rounded out to delicious citrus and malt with almost no bitterness on 11th infusion.
More lemongrass than oranges at 13th infusion.
Finish was quite long lasting and stuck thick to back of tongue.
Not much malt left in the nose on 17th infusion.

Mouthfeel on this tea was definitely very good and enjoyable.

Did 1st to last comparisons. 2nd infusion was like lemon chocolate truffle with briskness, while 2nd to last was more rounded lemongrass. 1st was refreshing lemons at this point, while last was almost pear like in body and sweetness. I would definitely like a cold tea like what that 1st infusion was selling.

Onto the big question in my head throughout this session: why get this instead of the Darjeeling first flush, or vice versa? I have no idea. So get both. You won’t be disappointed, unless citrus and lemongrass aren’t your thing.

I wish all tea shop teas were as consistently good to great as Ketlee’s. Looking forward to the 2024 crop.",4,DevOpsProDude

Sorry to disappoint but there is no chance you're getting genuine yixing for a tenner. That doesn't mean it's a bad gaiwan, it's just not yixing clay.

>I brewed some smoked Lapsang Souchong in it a couple of times which is quite a strong flavour. Is that going to impact it?

It'll be absolutely fine. Maybe if you brewed shou pu erh in a clay pot for several years and then brewed a really floral oolong you might get some unexpected results. In your case, if it's just a couple of times, it will be OK.",17,atascon

191prb5,kgxizva,"Making tea is about brewing a certain amount of leaves with a certain amount of water for a certain amount of time with a certain temperature.  
If you can control all these parameters enough for your needs and the tea has enough space to open up, you won´t have a benefit in taste by changing your brewing vessel.

If you mean a large 1+ liter tea pot with ""regular"", then a smaller vessel will have a benefit if you intend to brew ""really good"" tea. Because ""really good tea"" is often brewed best with relatively high leaf-water ratios, and with many steeps.

If your options are a Kyusu or a cast iron pot, go for the Kyusu. Because that´s meant to (and better in) brewing tea, a cast iron pot is for heating water. Another really simple, but really good option is just a metal basket infuser that you put directly into a cup. It is so great because it works for basically any tea and you can control the steeping time perfectly (because pulling it out takes like 0.2 seconds).",2,just_blue
191prb5,kgxk0uf,"From these 3 I would definitely go for kyusu. Eventually glass though I would prefer kyusu. Definitely not cast iron.

In case of kyusu I would recommend using a glazed one (unglazed will  affect the taste of tea. For first vessel you propably will want something neutral).

You can also buy a gaiwan it's also very good for tea.

My notes on the Xiaguan mention slight bitter and smoke, and I'm not getting either in early infusions. Longer infusions now bringing out a bit of bitter but still no smoke, Sweet is hanging on, though. Six infusions in without much change. Hitting the caffeine wall with my earlier Sencha.

Yixing is an extremely expensive type of clay which's also very porous and will absorbs tea aroma so it should be rsther used for one more specified type of tea.  Eventually you can buy some but it will be expensive and it will be much more specific. Yixing isn't necessarily bigger than gaiwan, it's volume vary alots depending on the particular teapot, so is a gawian also. 

>Or maybe some cast iron teapot

Nah  iron teapots are actually pretty bad for making a tea. They are good as a kettle though.


You may consider kyusu (yokode kyusu) teapot, it's volume vary but typically it's somewhere like 200-400ml. It has built in ceramic strainer to the teapot or eventually it has some metal strainer (typically built in, though I prefer ceramic one).  If you don't want a teapot to affect the tea taste then glazed kyusu could be a good choice. If you want the tea taste to changes it's taste then you can go for clay kyusu, especially if you like japanese greens. Particularly Tokoname clay is known for it's enchancing japanese tea taste, it reduces astrigency  enchances the umami. Though it should be mentioned here that tokoname clay is definitely less porous than say yixing

Kyusu is japanese teapot for typically japanese tea  though it will be very suitable for any kind of tea, it's also very convienient 

From other japanese ceramics there are shiboridashi's and   houhins. Though they will be typically quite small or very small (for example shibos can vary alot, shiboridashi can have like 100ml for example, but also alot less, I one shibo which holds 40ml of water)",9,I__Antares__I

For example, you claim 150ml gaiwan is small. This is not true, it is actually quite large gaiwan. Average size is 100ml. Put leaves in, put water, steep for few seconds, than pour into another vessel (gong dao bei, look up what it is and why is it used), than into cup and drink, or pour into cup, but traditional cups are around 40ml, so smaller than one gaiwan. You can steep the same leaves around 10 times based on how many leaves you used.

Yixing pots are next level, they can be very expensive and you should get some practice with brewing before getting one. You need to pick the right one for the right tea and use it correctly to really see how it improves tea.

Glass teapots, as suggested by others, are excelent entry point for brewing tea. They are cheap, easy to use (easier than gaiwan), and you can see how it the tea brewing. After a while get a standard 100ml porcelain gaiwan, no decorations or patterns, just white porcelain.",2,angelojch

Of course there is something like tea culture,  tea has a very wide history and has many cultural values.  Also there are many pottery vessels made specifically for tea that uses a technique to make from it an practical piece of art, there are many artistan means of expression in case of tea vessels, also for example japanese vessels will differ than say Chinese ones. How diffeent vessels differs from each other and how many difrent beautiful  things we can see in them (due to some artistic means of expression, like mogake) is amazing.


Tea is a ""normal daily thing"", though not necessarily (tea wides in quality, price and rareness extremely). Saying that there is no ""tea culture"" is like saying there is no culture assosiated with wines (and by the way, yes, you can age tea, just as you can age wine).  There are many cultural things assosiated with tea either, with tea ceremony etc. like you have japanese tea ceremony for matcha, or you have gong fu cha ceremony in chinese etc.

Neither am I. I wasn't criticing using simple methods, I was criticing your audacious claims that there is  no tea culture at all, then you equalize it with a daily basis product. Like of course you are free to treat it so, but for many people which are also a hobbyists on the tea topic it will be much much much more (though also it will be everyday drink). You can be as interested in tea like some wine connoisseur in wine.  In the latter, the tea will be much more than just some daily basis product. Not everyone has to be a tea hobbyist, nobody claims so, though it doesn't mean we should  equate to just some daily product without any culture that's assosiated with it is simply a nonsensical.

This approach may sound strange or too simple at first glance, but many Chinese people actually drink tea this way. I‘ll describe it briefly and then list 3 nice entry-level teas I can recommend.

You brew grandpa style by putting the tea leaves in a cup or glass, fill it with hot water, and just drink once it has cooled down enough without removing the leaves. Once the cup or glass is half empty, you refill with hot water. Repeat until the flavor is gone or you no longer want to drink.

Long Jing - a green tea with a nutty, sweet, and slightly roasted aroma. 1-2 teaspoons per cup (~300 mL), water around 80°C.

Shou Mei - a white tea with a gentle sweetness reminiscent of very ripe fruit (e.g. apples or peaches). 2-4 teaspoons per cup, water around 80°C.

1910p9t,kgrzwry,">black, white, green tea etc. that it comes from different parts of the tea plant

No. They are all made of tea leaves. Sometimes stems are included, but with few exceptions this is a sign of lower-quality tea. Different tea types are processed differently. 

>what does it mean when it says English Breakfast is a mix of black teas?

You know how if you buy three different brands of cheddar cheese they all taste slightly different because they come from different farms in different climates and maybe they have different breeds of cows? Tea is like that. English Breakfast, for example, is a mix of teas grown in different parts of Sri Lanka, Kenya, and India.

>with flavored teas, are they simply adding say jasmine leaves in with the tea leaves? And with earl grey they are adding the bergamont to the leaves? t isn’t artificial flavors?

Sometimes it is artificial flavors. With Earl Grey especially it is usually artificial flavor unless it's a higher-end Earl Grey, because bergamot is a little expensive. Low-priced jasmine tea also probably uses artificial flavors rather than real jasmine flowers. But yes, for nicer teas they are adding real bergamot citrus oil or real jasmine flowers during the processing stage. The jasmine flowers are usually removed after that stage because they can add a bitter flavor and all we want is the aroma.",46,YesWeHaveNoTomatoes

Here, ""black teas"" refers to fully oxidized teas from different parts of the world. They might combine an assam (from Assam), a ceylon (from Sri Lanka), and a keemun (from Qimen).

Jasmine pearls are one of my favs, the come out every year, and yunnan makes legit ones with real buds and very light but enduring flavor.

- two oolongs (probably the honey orchard mi lan xang and anxi hairy crab)
- a 60 ml gaiwan.

Where things get more complicated (i feel anyway) is chinese teas. These are much more ""pure"" tea than you will typically find in a bag or at the store. So its much more potent. Chinese teas even in small amounts can make multiple cups of tea if prepared correctly. I have found they are easier to ""burn"" aka steep too hot and get bitter though. Bagged tea can withstand a bit more of a beating temp and time wise as its just more processed. 

There are a ton of ways to brew tea and you will find what you like, expecially if you keep an eye on this sub. There are also good guides linked in the sub discription :) have fun and dont get too overwhelmed. The world of tea is big!

On Chinese teas, I often see people writing that they are finicky, but I regularly abuse both fresh sheng puer and Chinese whites and the tea is always enjoyable (though I must admit the sheng can get a bit harsh). “Grandpa style” is also a popular way to drink them, where you just put the leaves straight into a big cup, pour hot water on it, and drink when it’s cold enough (never removing the leaves from the cup).",6,laksemerd

You appear to be new to tea, so here are some resources to help get you started.  First, be sure to check out our sidebar, we have some useful stuff there.  There is a quick reference with the guidelines on what temperature water to use, and how long to steep your tea.

[The FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/wiki/faq) was put together to answer many of the questions you may have, including more detailed guides for brewing tea.

If you are looking for places to buy tea, we have [The User's Choice Vendor List](https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/wiki/vendors/page_01) which was voted on by the users here.

[The Non-Judgemental Guide to Tea](http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/01/tea-for-everyone.html) is probably one of the best guides we've seen, and is highly recommended reading.

If you're more interested in iced tea, [The Tea Lover's Way to Make the Best Cold Brew Iced Tea](http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/06/how-to-make-the-best-cold-brew-iced-tea.html) might be just what you're looking for.

For smaller leaf teas that may have more broken bits, I find the filter valuable. It especially finds use when I am drinking very broken leaf Japanese greens such as tencha or fukamushicha.

The filter is definitely a more recent addition to the list of gong fu utensils.

In a black tea they bring a kind of barley malt sweetness. 

If you really really do want more clarity though, I have seen filters that use a fine fabric instead of a metal mesh. You can usually spot them online by the little string that ties the fabric to the body of the strainer. That may be able to keep the hairs out of your tea.

Just get a nice shui ping, pick a tea or a complementary group of teas that you will brew in it and become familiar with how it retains heat and affects your brews.

What I would say is that for shou you probably want something that retains as much heat as possible. So if you brew a lot of shou maybe don’t get a really small pot (<100ml) as they lose heat quicker.

1911uwk,kgthum7,"Thanks for your response! To clarify, I'm looking for 2 clay recommendations here. I plan to assign each tea their individual teapot. Sorry for the lack of clarity!

I feel fairly confident in my ability to learn how a clay/teapot functions. My experience is in Chaozhou, Jianshui, and some local clays, just no experience in Yixing specifically. Is there a reason why clay-tea pairings isn't essential for my first yixing teapot? There are just so many types of Yixing: Zini, Zhuni, Hong Ni, Duanni, Lu Ni, etc. I'd like to hear from those who know the nature of some of these clays, so I can make a decently educated decision.

I've heard Zini and Duanni might be good choices for Shou Pu'er, but I'm afraid that these clays might mute the elements of Shou that I really like. I've also heard that Zhuni and Hong Ni a good clay for green oolongs like Dong Ding, but again, I'd like to hear from those who use these clays to see their opinions. 

100ML is honestly my average when it comes to my 1-person sessions. I think I'd just shift my brewing style to match the loss in heat-retention if its a size issue.

Also, thank you for your recommendation for the Shui Ping style. I was leaning towards that shape for Shou Pu'er. I was thinking about Fang Gu for Dong Ding, so the leaves have plenty of room to expand.",1,benbojammin
1911uwk,kgtjaxx,"Thanks so much for responding. From your experience does Luni and Duanni mute less over time? I have a tendency to brew my shou pu'er strong, and have a preference towards the darker earthier shous (i.e. Bulang Shou). Perhaps Zini would be the better option, or something less porous like Zhuni?

Is there a specific reason why you recommend Zhuni for Dong Ding? I've heard other people recommend this because it preserves aroma and is less porous. Just curious of your thoughts.

Also, Xiangyu is such an interesting shape! It reminds me of the Hiragata Kyusu shape from Japan.",1,benbojammin
1911uwk,kgvjl82,">Is there a reason why clay-tea pairings isn't essential for my first yixing teapot?

In my experience clay-tea pairings aren't necessarily objective and easily-replicable truths. There are a number of reasons for this such as differences between different batches of each clay type, different shapes, firing methods, wall thickness, old/modern clay, etc etc. Or you could even just end up with something that isn't yixing at all.

If you've never tried yixing before it's also tempting to take comments about muting or enhancing at face value and worry that you may purchase the 'wrong' teapot. In the [words](https://anmo-art-cha.com/blogs/blog/yixing-paodee-interview-with-bok) of one experienced collector: ""*The biggest misconception is the expectation that \[yixing\] will fundamentally change the tea drinking experience. It can, but not necessarily so.""* A nice shou will be nice whether it's brewed in (genuine) zhuni or duanni.

When you're buying your first teapot I think it's important to keep in mind that there is a hierarchy of features that can potentially impact flavour and clay type is not necessarily at the top of the list, nor is it easy to make generalisations about it as I alluded to above. So using clay type as the main criteria for your first pot narrows your options and may not give you the results you think it will. Which brings me back to vendor reputation, aesthetics, ergonomics and volume as more important factors. Clearly if your collection expands and you have a wider reference base then buying based on clay type can make more sense.

If you are really intent on exploring clay-tea pairings and you want this to drive your purchase then there are a lot of quite in-depth discussions on [TeaChat](https://www.teachat.com/) and [TeaForum](https://www.teaforum.org/) about all kinds of combinations of teas and pots. If you do a google search for duanni and shou, for example, you already get a few results from both forums.",3,atascon
1911uwk,kgvyj72,"I think you make a really strong point here. And it honestly matches my experiences with my own pre-conception of clays like Jianshui; it's heat retention and 'muting' affects dissuade many from using it from more aromatic teas, but I've found if you adjust your brewing style to the teapot, you'll make a really stellar brew with any kind of tea. You've made me feel a lot more comfortable about my choice in teapot, regardless of what I choose, so thanks.

I always go loose leaf, preferred brewing in dedicated yixing or gaiwan. I don’t really do anything special to it other than try to bring out its flavors as best I can.

I dont know exactly what you mean about how they do it in china, but I prefer gongfu as an approach.

I don’t think I am the most knowledgeable but I think I know. A decent amount. Specifically regarding the marketing, I have found that the dishonest around what is being sold can make it hard to get really familiar with yancha. Tons of things being sold as Da Hong Pao as if they are top shelf when really they are hill teas with a harsh roast. I really wish there was more consistent messaging regarding what things are rather than everything attempting to portray itself as an inner region cliff tea.

I generally find it a bit challenging to find reliable information on yancha. I hope this is the kind of response you were looking for!",1,BreakerB5
190rzv7,kgrs16x,"Thanks so much for your reply man!

The Rock Tea market in China is quite intricate. Some small tea merchants from the hills tend to inflate prices based on their tea's place of origin. This discourages many Rock Tea enthusiasts, resulting in the absence of a good brand.

and most traditional locals from Wuyi Mountain are unfamiliar with overseas markets and customers, which is why I aim to create an international brand. My concern is that most overseas customers or tea enthusiasts are accustomed to teabag brands like Lipton, which are not suitable for experiencing Rock Tea. Also, based on my understanding, some customers add flavorings like ginger powder to their tea leaves, which worries me.

Mouthfeel was super silky.
Finish was rich caramel sweetness.

Nose evolved to include a little plum by the 10th infusion.

The aromas coming off the liquor were definitely a cut above in terms of enjoyment and complexity throughout the session.

Empty cup had aromas of vanilla and caramel.

Did 1st to last comparisons. 2nd infusion was light, thick, and a little sweet, while 2nd to last was almost apricots on the nose with plum on palate. 1st infusion was very light, while last was like light honey fruit nectar.

18zw2w0,kgkcqgr,I went for longer initial steeps with mine but 5g/100ml seems about right.,12,Shefour
18zw2w0,kgm4m3w,"Dancong is usually 100C unlike usual oolong ""guidelines"" (but when the kettle stops rolling with no sound), Flash Steeps, no waiting with 1 wash. And perhaps a few seconds ranging from 3-10 secs on later steeps (up to personal preference), 7-8g per 100-120ml. 8 grams or more for Chao Zhou drinkers compared to general Gongfu Tea drinkers. Good Dancong leaves should be able to brew 100c with little flaws. Do take note on the thickness of gaiwan you use. Thicker gaiwan like Ruyao could bring out bolder flavors and mute the fragrance. Chao Zhou Gongfu usually uses very thin gaiwan.

\*For Dancong, sometimes if you use too little leaves, it might not give you the full potential. That's why Gongfu method flash steeps with larger leaf to water ratio is best.

Usually just using Gaiwan. While sometimes Chaozhou Teapot could bring out some of the more subtle taste where a gaiwan could not. I have tried Dancong where gaiwan would taste awful but using a Chaozhou teapot taste great.

If it's astringent, lasting bitter aftertaste which do not transform to 'Huigan' (returning sweetness) quickly enough, it's usually cheaper lower quality leaves. Ranges about 180-300+ RMB per 500g online in China. Fragrance could be high but it's a clear separation from smell vs taste, often having good fragrance but mediocre taste with some flaws.

Mid-range quality leaves should show little flaws, great fragrance and mouth feel, and should start to go flat at about 5-7 steep onwards. The drop in flavors and fragrance is significant and quite balanced, while fragrance and water would 'merge' more. It could have an obvious drop in fragrance and taste at around 5th-8th steep onwards with ""water taste"" starts to show. Average about 400+ to 700 rmb per 500g market selling price.

Higher quality leaves are more consistent throughout. With minimal or no obvious flaws, while focus on how good the tea could give. EG... Have better merge of the ""fragrance in the water"". The ""viscosity"" of the water would look thicker and richer in nutrients. New tea drinker might not appreciate the more expensive higher quality material as the flavors and fragrances would not be as 'apparent' as the mid-range. Could last up to 10 brews or more depending on personal preference. The drop in flavors and fragrance throughout the steeps drops gently and consistently. You could enjoy the flavors getting more and more bland very slowly and not a suddenly drop with obvious ""water-taste"". These grade of tea range about 700 to 1500+ rmb per 500g. Anything higher in market selling price drops in significant difference.

There are some differences between different bakers or sellers too. Some bakers focus more on the lighter taste and higher fragrance, while some are more towards the bolder, ""thicker"" taste. By sellers I mean the vendors where they bring in the raw leaves from farmers and bake them before selling.",11,Cordovan147

In the past, the water was heated by hard dense charcoal derived from olive pits, providing a low but consistent heat, allowing for the kettle to be placed on the charcoal stove for protracted periods without it reaching a rolling boil. By the time water hits 100C at a rolling boil, it becomes rapidly de-oxygenated and is considered “dead” and makes for a poor brew.

Then the water should be okay. Most green teas I had were to let steep for three to four minutes. Just try it out and adjust to your preference.

As other users pointed out before me: Tea should be stored in a dark and close to air tight container. If you can get your hands on a dark brown glass jar, use that. If that is out of the question, put the plastic container in a dark cupboard or some other storage device.
Also I recommend to mix the tea (to homogenize it). The parts that were exposed to light over a longer period have surely lost quality-wise, those parts that were inside and shielded from light might be in a better condition. Put it in a bowl and mix it through, then put it back inside the plastic container or preferably a glass jar and store it in the dark to prevent further deterioration.

Edit: I have googled the brand and when you compare the coloration on your photograph with the pictures on their website, the effect of prolonged exposure to daylight becomes evident.

You can find cheap ""Da Hong Pao"" on Alixpress etc, but it's not going to be good quality and probably not authentic Da Hong Pao. It's kind of like asking where to get fine wine from Burgundy on the cheap.

But if that doesn't dissuade you and you're just looking for something like might be served at a Chinese restaurant,, I'd try Ebay or Taobao, or even an Asian market if you have one somewhere near you.

190lu6z,kguhaso,"Da Hong Pao is a variety of Wuyi rock tea. Broadly speaking, there are two types of Da Hong Pao. One is the pure Qi Dan variety, and the other is a blended tea with various varieties such as Narcissus, Cinnamon, and Tie Luo Han. The advantage of the Qi Dan variety lies in its balanced taste and aroma, with a unique fragrance resembling osmanthus flowers. The blending of Da Hong Pao varies among different tea masters, depending on their preferences and blending skills. Each brand generally has its own unique and proprietary techniques.

As for the rock charm (岩韵) of Da Hong Pao, it depends on the raw materials and processing techniques. In general, only authentic rock-grown Da Hong Pao exhibits a distinct rock charm, often described as a mineral or rocky flavor, which is what you understand as mineral or rocky taste. However, this type of Da Hong Pao typically comes at a normal price ranging from 50 to 300 euros per 250 grams. The depth of the tea color is influenced by the degree of oxidation and roasting. The Da Hong Pao you described seems to be a traditional one with deep oxidation and heavy roasting.",1,iteaworld

In the North, still a lot of jasmine/lotus tea, but hot or cold depends on the time of year. There is a region of tea growing in the rural, mountainous area north west of Hanoi. Maybe try that as they are quite close to Yunnan. Since the French colonial time, coffee has taken over, and within the last 20 years, boba/milk tea as well.

Edit: forgot about Hue. Hue has a unique tea culture since it’s the capital of the last dynasty.

190d4kc,kgnusw8,"A couple PSAs before I proceed! Firstly, no tea will ever be “honey sweet”, so when I say sweet I mean *it tends to have more sweet notes than other types*. I also don’t think there are truly sweet flavored teas, sweeter than the blackcurrant one you’re drinking. Flavoring comes from essential oils, and they don’t tend to be sweet. Feel free to research essential oils that taste sweet and look for teas that contain this flavor. 

Secondly, I’ve never drunk coffee in my life so perhaps you have higher tolerance for caffeine, but FYI black tea also contains caffeine and therefore makes your heart race (mine for sure). 

Now to the point. There are teas that have less caffeine. Oolong is a fantastic option because it’s naturally sweet and less caffeinated. I recommend milky oolong, it’s the most common type and is available in tea bags, too. 

Herbal teas are caffeine free. There are thousands of blends out there, but a lot of them are also naturally sweet. Camomile is probably the most commercially available one, but there are other blends that are worth exploring.

There was a wealth of knowledge and experience in both the vendors and the attendees, and everyone I met was extremely friendly and eager to discuss. There was also a lot of beautiful tea ware, not sure about custom but I think it's a great place to look.

I attended three panels. My memory is a bit hazy, but one was about different herbal blends and gave us a lot of great ideas. Other panel topics ranged from tea in parts of history or the future, blending, personal stories of tea makers, and how to market your tea company. Not all of them landed for me but i still gained a lot of valuable information. All of the presenters stayed after the panels and were happy to discuss any questions or ideas. 

We got to try a lot of unique and special teas and overall, it was a transformative experience for most of us. I think if you have an open mind and are willing to speak with everyone around you, you'll make a lot of useful contacts and get inspiration for your business. Their app makes it easier to keep track of who you network with as well.

The downside of last year was its conjunction with the bar and restaurant expo, so there was a mix of crowds and the tea expo side seemed tiny in comparison. There were food stands there and the aromas would travel, so there were times it interfered with my senses when trying a new tea. I don't believe that will be the case this year and it will only be WTE, so honestly you'll likely have an easier time networking with only tea folks around. 

As for attire, it was a mix of casual and business casual. I wore a casual dress and zipup hoodie. My coworkers wore shorts+sweater, khakis+blouse, etc There was every kind of attire there other than pajamas so I say don't overthink it and wear whatever is comfortable and makes you feel confident in yourself and your business.

I'm not going this year, but I wish you the best of luck with both your business and at world tea expo! Like a lot of things, the experience is what you make it and if you're bold enough to look for what you want you will find it. Cheers",3,iatemylavalamp

For certain types of teas like green tea (especially Japanese greens) that are high in catechins it is sometimes recommended to agitate the leaves as little as possible during steeping to prevent over extraction of tannins, so a gooseneck helps with this although the difference is probably subtle.

\- The lid pops open fairly abruptly, unlike a Breville I've used before, which could potentially fling a drop of hot water if you're not careful.  
\- The power cable has grommets on the bottom of the base to adjust the orientation of the cable that it crunches into with some difficulty.  
\- Construction is decent but the walls on the kettle are relatively thin so they transmit heat quickly.

18zs9s2,kgjojnd,"Brewed Gong Fu style. 5 g tea to 50ish ml water at 212 F. Gaiwan, cha hai, cup warmed. Tea steamed. 2 x flash steeps. 5 seconds, 10 s, 15 s, 20s, 20 s, 20 s, 20 s, 25 s, 30 s, 35 s, 40 s, 1 minute, 2 m, 4 m, 8 m

Steamed leaves smell quite delicious with a mix of fruit and a little camphor.
Nose was camphor and note of humidity.
Silky mouthfeel to start, but unexceptional. Hope it thickens during the session.
Finish was thick citrus.
Palate was brisk and bold. Very enjoyable.

Mouthfeel did start thickening on the 5th infusion.
Cream note finally deciphered on nose and palate after liquor calmed down on the 10th infusion.
Finish was long lasting.

The leaves had good endurance, but I definitely pushed too hard with all those 20 second steeps. One less would have been good.

This is another tea that mostly is what it is. Not a lot of evolution during the session. It’s still a step up from last night’s W2T cake in terms of overall package.

Did 1st to last comparisons. 2nd infusion was heavy on the camphor note with bakers chocolate palate, while 2nd to last was cream and citrus nose, smooth palate, thick mouthfeel and that tasty finish. 1st infusion was delicious camphor with nice brisk quality, while last was rounded and also a little brisk, which suggests the leaves had maybe a little more left to give if one wanted to try a 16 or 20 minute steep to finish it out.

This cake is fairly expensive at $148, so whether or not it’s worth it really depends on your preference for the profile. It is a good quality tea that has been stored with care and is very enjoyable for what it is. My notes match PJ’s pretty well and the session was enjoyable.",1,DevOpsProDude

First off, a tetsubin is a cast iron kettle. In Japan it is kettles that are typically made of iron, not teapots. A cast iron teapot is not authentic to Japanese tea culture. 

Second, and my biggest issue, is functionality. Cast iron holds heat very well, but it has to suck up a bunch of heat to do so. If you pour boiling water into a cast iron teapot, the iron absorbs a lot of heat and your tea won't be brewed at a high temperature. You can work around this by preheating the cast iron pot. but then you have a very hot pot that can burn/leave marks on your table if you don't place it on a trivet. And theres rusting and other issues. Cast iron is just not an ideal material for a teapot compared to ceramic.",69,redpandaflying93
18z6odi,kgfnx0w,"There are a LOT of fake Tetsubins.   
A real one is pure iron, no enamel, and it's to boil your water in (a kettle), NOT to make tea, because the iron makes the tea taste better. The tea is then made in a tea pot.  
It doesn't rust so easily if you use it right (use at least once a month, on a flame or something else where the pot isn't standing flat on full surface (gas stove is fine, conduction and such isn't without wiping the bottom afterwards and letting it dry on a drying rack), bringing the water you don't need to a boil again after having made your tea, pouring it out immediately, and letting it stand open to cool without wiping the inside.   
This process sounds a lot more complicated than it is. Basically just regularly use it and pour all the water out while the kettle is still hot, then let it cool without the lid.

The fake tetsubin are tea pots, as in, you CANNOT boil water in them without poisoning yourself as the enamel cracks. You put leaf and water in, then pour tea out. Then wipe the inside or put it upside down on a drying rack.",37,lopgir

Tetsubin or cast iron kettle is for boiling water. I assume from the link you provided that the tetsubin in your meaning is enamel one which is a recent invention.

So enamel cast iron kettle are, in principle, the same as ceramic tea kettle.

I don't hate it, but if I was to use tools from arrays of Japanese tea equipment I'd go for kyusu or houhin because it's functional and has more traditional esthetic to it. Enamel cast iron is for some fancy tea session that I intend for certain way of presentation.

In fact, I own both the tetsubin which I rarely use to boil water except for the full Japanese tea session i.e. premium leaves from Uji, water from certain source like Somei well in Kyoto that I think it worth the hassle to use tetsubin to boost the water for Japanese tea flavors.

I almost never use enamel cast iron because ceramic tea kettle and Kyushu are quite convenient in both brewing and pouring for my everyday informal session. That's for me though.

Feel the dancing of the water through your hand and its excitement to become something more! There is more to tea than just drinking! But these are just my ramblings. You do you.

Someone who is new to this kind of product doesn't know if it can have issues or not. But being all-knowing like you comes with the unfortunate consequence of forgetting what it's like to be a lesser, not all-knowing person, someone else wanting to hear things you don't find useful is no longer comprehensible to you. It must be so hard to be completely detached from the average person you cannot understand why your ""advice"" for people to stop asking for advice is not appreciated as the best thing that happened to them.

Despite your insistence that there is nothing to gleam people have said that 1) quality varies wildly and 2) it's a kettle not a tea pot and so it's not well suited to be used as a tea pot. Both of which I listed as a possibility in my response, to everyone's shock and surprise since after all it's just a piece of cast iron and there is nothing further to gleam from it. And both of which are useful to someone who is a novice like OP, no wait, neither of which can possibly be useful to anyone because everyone already knows all that you know. Theory of mind is hard for some people, not you though of course.

Perhaps it's time to consider whether it's best to take a step back and allow others who might have better advice than ""it's a piece of cast iron you heat water in"" to answer this one. Perhaps it's time to brush up on theory of mind.",6,muskytortoise

Most cheap kyusu are going to be in the 300mL+ range. And even then, stoneware kyusu are going to tend to be unglazed. You can find glazed porcelain kyusu in that size range, but those are going to be white in color, and often not cheap.

I wouldn't worry too much about glazing though. Tokoname clay is not very porous, nothing like the clays used in Yixing pots. Tokoname clay doesn't really absorb flavor in the same way, and I use my little unglazed pot for many different types of tea without any flavor bleeding over.

As for filter, most people would say that a ceramic filter is superior to a metal filter in most cases. Metal filters in ceramic kyusu are normally not removable, and while they can be good for really broken leaf tea like fukamushicha, they are notoriously hard to clean.",1,Outside_Resolve503

18z4guq,kgk7pdv,"I'm in London so I have direct access to a fair amount of London's most established tea shops, which is nice. [Postcard Teas](https://www.postcardteas.com/site/) and [The Chinese Tea Company](https://the-chinese-tea-company.com/) are probably my favourite London shops, both with an online presence too. I think Postcard actually has more inventory online than in person nowadays, specifically if you're buying bulk 1kg packs. 

[What-Cha](https://what-cha.com/) is also a UK based online only vendor, it doesn't specialise quite as much as the other two, and I'd say its offerings are basically middling across the board, but there's nothing wrong with that, and if you just want easy drinking, good loose leaf that isn't going to break your bank balance, that's pretty much all they stock. Both The Chinese Tea Company and Postcard sell really affordable, good teas as well, but they also stock some pretty premium stuff. For example, you just can't get typical commodity grade longjing style tea from Postcard, only award winning artisan West Lake stuff that's like £3/g 😅. If you're in London, definitely check out the physical shops if you can though. 

The big elephant in the room when it comes to UK vendors is Mei Leaf. Their online presence is huge, and they're UK based, so the markup that people from other countries would be dealing with isn't really something that applies to us so much, since shipping is actually quick and cheap, and we'd be eating some costs for importing ourselves anyway. 

Having said that, Don Mei, the owner, has a somewhat storied history of selling teas with provenance claims that just couldn't be true (1000+ year old trees), as well as being involved in alternative medicine and having a certain mindset that aligns with that practice. The teas he sells aren't exactly bad though, there's somewhat of a reverse circle jerk on here where people act like he's selling you bottom of the barrel pisswater brews for £1/g, which is definitely not true. Having said that, the question of whether you want to buy from someone who's demonstrated either massive inexperience and gullibility as a vendor (in believing the claims of 1000yo trees), or willful dishonesty to sex up his teas' marketability, is very legitimate. Since I'm sure you've either heard of them or are bound to bump into them online, I thought I may as well summarise things in this post rather than have you end up in the middle of an internet flamewar regarding them ha. 

If you want to know anything about the China based vendors I buy from, just ask. Also this ended up being a longer post than I anticipated, hope you made it through ok.",4,CHI_TSE_BEENG_CHA

I mainly order from Yee On Tea Co, Wuyi Origin, and Daxue Jiadao if I'm ordering from China, but the last one is only for when I really want some special teas (just look at the prices and you'll understand why lol). 

Yee On is a Hong Kong based shop that largely specialises in puerh, but they store and age their puerh in the traditional Hong Kong way, which gives the tea a very powerful earthy ginseng like note. It does mellow out what is usually a somewhat abrasive tea (raw puerh) when young, but the storage notes can be very overpowering for some people, who aren't necessarily fans. Definitely somewhat of a marmite thing, or on acquired taste. 

I can't say I have any favourite teas to recommend, because everyone's different so I'm not sure my personal favourites are necessarily general crowd pleasers. I've found that most of my friends who aren't regular tea drinkers tend to be into fragrant oolongs like tieguanyin and dancongs, as well as unsmoked black teas from Tong Mu village (more famous in the west for Lapsong Souchong).",1,CHI_TSE_BEENG_CHA

It was eye opening and shocking when I started carefully reading the nutritional labels on some of our kitchen staples. We know soda, pastry,  and ice cream should be limited but, you find high amounts of added sugar in many brands of bread, bottled salad dressings/sauces,  frozen foods and more.  It was a bit of a learning curve when we first started to attack that area in our diet, but now we have new staples and we know how to translate ingredient labels and nutrition info quickly so we can make better choices. 

Cheers!",3,ATreeGrowinBklyn
18zuylh,kglmqww,"I avoid things like monkfruit and the Swerve and all that for one reason: Erythritol is the main ingredient and a little bit can KILL a dog. I don't use Aspartame or Saccharine because the Aspartame put holes in my mother's brain and Saccharine just tastes disgusting.

Why is Saccharine in toothpaste? Can't get away from the stuff.

Xylitol, which is in whitening gum, is a doggie-killer, too. So I don't chew gum anymore either.

I don't actually put sugar in my coffee or tea unless it's a flavoured syrup or molasses.

I dislike both strains of Stevia (A and B). I can't put my finger on why.

But then I live off Splenda, so it's pretty much just pick ya poison. Whichever you find the flavour profile of that tastes best to you.",1,SilverbladesFate
18zuylh,kgki368,You could try stevia in the raw. I love that. Regular stevia tastes like butt to me at least. Sometimes I'll do a half packet Splenda half packet stevia in the raw if I'm dying for a perfect overt sweetness but ye,0,midnite999
18zuylh,kgldtyj,"One thing that helped me transition to drinking coffee and tea black is pairing a small, usually dry pastry with it, like a butter cookie.  The hot tea unlocks more aroma from the pastry and the pastry adds sweetness and creaminess to the experience.  Many teas have their own sweetness that progressively becomes more noticeable in the back of your throat as you sip and let it linger.
But it does take time to shift your diet and allow your palate to shift with it.  Same goes for trying to reduce salt.",0,Interesting-Cloud630
18zuylh,kgmkty9,"Tricky to replicate the neutral sweetening which sugar provides. You might try blonde coconut sugar, which has less of that brown sugar taste than the raw type.

18zuylh,kgp9j6l,"I feel you on this. I also struggle with staying low sugar and dislike something about nearly every sugar substitute out there. I hate the taste of stevia and saccharine, and monkfruit also has a strange aftertaste to me. The only sweetener that tastes “clean” to me is sucralose (which is controversial). One of the biggest things that bothers me about Splenda is filler. So, I found some very affordable 100% sucralose powder and made my own sweet drops. I only use it for a cup of coffee or tea every day, so it’s not something I use in huge quantities (like substituting all sugar in cooking/baking), and starting with something pure and simple gives me more peace of mind about it.",1,PsychologicalHall142

18zdp6f,kggt8oc,"I'll start by saying I'm not sure if the level of smokiness in this tea qualifies it as a flavored puer, but that doesn't bother me because it's incredibly enjoyable. This tea offers a captivating experience from start to finish, and the end only arrives when you decide to tap out, as the tea continues to deliver.

The journey begins when you open the container, and you're immediately hit with a scent reminiscent of a recent fire in a pine forest. Breaking it apart leaves your hands, pick, and tray with a lingering aroma, much like the scent that clings to a jacket worn around a campfire the next day.

The initial steep is dominated by a bold smokiness, and the fragrance left in the beaker after pouring transports me back to memories of small Texas BBQ shacks. As you continue to steep, the tea gradually unveils a slightly sweet and juicy young raw familiarity that lurks behind the powerful smokiness. This tea generously offers around 15 full force pots before it begins to lose its intensity, but even then, there's a lingering essence up to the 20th steeping.

1. Make sure the tea is made with actual oil of bergamot. Most mass market brands will be made with artificial flavourings, which imho give a very different effect.

2. Instead of a tea flavoured with oil of bergamot, try a tea made with bits of bergamot rind, which gives a different flavour that some people find less aggressively perfumey.

3. Teas marketed as “Lady Grey” are usually an Earl Grey with a less aggressive bergamot presence.

18ze53l,kgh84l6,"I think the ""boil water before drinking"" part is the most important. I think the same changes could have happened with boiled water -- if you could get people to want to drink boiled water. Tea just made boiled water the better alternative to unboiled water.  
To see what is causation vs correlation, we can look at other dense premodern societies and compare. China, then Japan, became the densest, advanced ancient cultures only after tea, with low rates of many diseases in urban areas. If you look at Rome, London, Constantinople, and other large, ancient cities, they were absolute cesspits of disease. I'd argue that boiling water to make tea allowed intense urbanization without high disease load because we have alternate examples and they were disgusting.

And although tea was indeed a luxury good when it first appeared in Europe, it was a common drink in Asia (although there were always luxury versions available for the elite). It started largely in monasteries to keep monks awake and spread from there to the broad population. Visiting European travelers remarked on how ubiquitous tea consumption was among the poor and rich.",1,ScoJoMcBem

>After a hard night’s toil, poling and walking in a nipping frost, I wished to see the breakfast by which they laid the physical basis for another day’s work. At the stern of the boat, resting on a little furnace, was the universal rice-pot, and beside it a small covered wooden tub, full of rice. Some pickled or boiled slices of the huge radish called dai-kon lay in another receptacle. The drink was the cheapest tea ... The first course was a bowlful of rice and a pair of chop sticks. In the second course, history repeated itself. The third course was a dipperful of tea... The fourth course was a bowl of rice and two slices of radish; the fifth was the same. A dipperful of tea-liquor finished the meal, and the pole was resumed. (Griffis, Mikado’s Empire, II, 409–10)

and

>An added reason \[for lack of disease in Japanese cities\] may well have been the ubiquitous drinking of tea. However careful people in a city of half a million or more are, they are dependent on wells and sluices, and water is bound to become polluted. Yet in Japan, adults and children did not drink cold, unboiled, water. The infants drank their mother’s milk, which would have contained high levels of bacteria-destroying phenolics from their mother’s tea drinking. Adults and children once weaned just drank tea, which was made with boiled water. (Macfarlane and Macfarlane 2004: 79)

If you want a specific brand, Bitterleaf tea has one for cheap I really like, if they still have it in stock. If not, Yunnansourcing's is okay too. 

For an herbal tea blend, try out Mariage Feres' Rouge Metis. It's a blend of rooibos (which is already sweet as it is) with various flowers and berries. It's like a fruity desert presented as a nice, warm mug of herbal tea, and does scratch that sweet tooth itch of mine.",3,gyokuro8882

As a kid I also put sugar in tea. One year when I was teen I gave up sugar in tea for Lent.

Ultimately, the majority of people making tea related content are vendors trying to market products. This may not always be direct and overt like Don Mei tasting his own teas and telling you how he's getting hints of the fresh tears of a unicorn foal, but even documentary and ""educational"" type videos from these channels isn't educating you in the wider world of tea per se, it's educating you to adopt a mindset that's conducive to valuing what those specific vendors have to offer.

There are some legitimately unaffiliated channels out there like TeaDB, but I must confess I find TeaDB incredibly dull (as much as I think the people involved are decent), and if you're not largely into puerh tea there's not much of interest on the channel.

So basically in a nutshell, try to listen more to tea drinkers than tea sellers, even if the former might still be somewhat influenced by marketing, they're less likely to be giving you as much one dimensional information.

The most generous interpretation is that he's getting scammed himself by his wholesalers, then passing along the scam to unsuspecting customers. But at this point, it's difficult to believe he doesn't know the things he's saying are bullshit. 

With Don, it's not even so much that he gets individual facts wrong. He does—his Yixing videos are embarrassingly terrible—but the real issue is his framing. Everything he sells is the best, which means his videos ""educating"" beginners on what to look for in certain tea styles tend to align perfectly with the tea he sells... 

It sounds like it wouldn't matter, but it leads to people watching his videos for years and still not understanding what makes good tea.

One other interesting difference with Scotch is that the tea community doesn't have as robust a tradition of ""reviewing."" In Scotch forums, videos, and blogs, the bread and butter content is a tasting and review of a particular Scotch. That doesn't happen nearly as often with tea. There is good reason for this, of course. Tea is much more variable: the ""same"" tea can be picked, processed, stored and brewed in different ways (including with different waters, different brewing vessels, and on and on); it can also change from season to season (a fall picking tastes very different from a spring, etc).

Smoke on the nose to start.
Silky mouthfeel.
Palate had tartness to it along with muscat grapes and a little minerality.
Tartness lingered in the finish at first.

Good beginning.

Smoke on nose dissipated a bit after 6 infusions which allowed muscat grapes to come in along with a floral note.
Tea settled down nicely after 8th infusion.
Finish bloomed to thick coating of back of tongue and nice sweetness.

Did 1st vs last comparisons. 2nd infusion was nice tartness with hints of dark chocolate. 2nd to last was rounded muscat grapes and not much else. 1st infusion was brisk grapes at this point. Last infusion definitely showed the leaves were finally spent.

Not a bad session, but the tea didn’t really evolve after the start much. It did have excellent longevity though and a nice finish. I was expecting more from this tea and it didn’t quite get there.

Famous winery charges $48.

Sometimes there are valid reasons like it really is better quality, greatly reduced production for that vintage/year/season.

18ydhhf,kgbsskn,"I just read a very thorough study about caffeine in tea. I should translate that and post here when I have time. Here's a summary:

Caffeine is to protect the plant. The younger and more tender parts of the tea tree contain more caffeine, whereas the older the raw materials, the less caffeine they contain; Summer tea has higher caffeine content than spring tea; Large-leaf species generally contain more caffeine than medium and small-leaf species; Caffeine begins to sublimate into a gas when the temperature reaches 178°C. Therefore, tea leaves that have been roasted at high temperatures for a long time or have a pot-shaking process have relatively less caffeine, the caffeine content of the tea leaves is reduced during the roasting process.

Pu-Erh is Dark Tea, not Black Tea. Genmaicha is Green Tea. Genmaicha is made with small-leaf species and roasted with rice. It's known to have a relatively lower caffeine content. Pu-Erh is made with large-leaf species from Yunnan. But they are made with larger leaves. They are about medium on the scale.

Yes, most tea can be steeped multiple times if you use the traditional Chinese method. The first steep releases the most caffeine. And it also depends on how long you wait. I think you are talking about riped Pu-erh. Because of the unsanitary ripening process in the 80s, there is often a muddy smell. Most people have the habit of throwing away the first steep anyway.

For pu-erh, you generally use 5 grams per 150 ml of water at 100C, steep for 10 seconds, add 10 seconds for each subsequent steep. Tea is a journey, not a fixed formula. Why don't you experiment and see how you like it?",5,Living_Wallaby_9966
18ydhhf,kgakk6b,WASTING? I steep my puerh 5-6 times western style before throwing it out,3,throwaway61763
18ydhhf,kgbkj8y,"There’s two main types of pu’erh, “raw” and “ripe”, though they couldn’t be more dissimilar.

If it’s ripe, leaves will typically be darker and will brew up a rich, dark brown/orange tea with little bitterness and more earthy notes

If it’s raw, leaves will be greener and the brew will be very much like a green tea, light green/yellow and slightly bitter with floral characteristics.

Raw, uncooked, and sheng all refer to the same thing.

Ripe, cooked, and shou all refer to the same thing.

If you’re doing like multiple minutes long steepings to make a big pot/multiple cups, and the pu’erh is loose (not compressed into a cake or brick) then typically you’ll get most of the flavour out of it by minute 5. Could reseteep it but it’ll be much weaker.

If you’re doing quick 20-30 second brews (gongfu style) to make one cup at a time, you can resteep the leaves 5-10 times to unlock all the flavours. If it’s compressed, you can get even more steeps out as it slowly opens up.

I’m not qualified enough to speak on caffeine content, but as per flavour, I personally prefer gongfu style to make only a cup at a time with shorter steepings. Balances the flavour throughout multiple cups, and the change in taste over subsequent brews is quite interesting. 

However, the best way to brew pu’erh is the way **you** prefer. Folks just get a bit upset at this post as not resteeping (if doing gongfu style) leads to quite a bit of wasted tea, like only eating the skin off an apple and tossing the rest away.",3,Tjah78
18ydhhf,kgaj91h,I’m just going to say it all varies. Some growers aim for Caffeine and some do not. It really varies. I’ve had blacks that put me to sleep and I’ve had whites that still have me buzzed the next day.,2,Pungicity

But if you get into good puerh , you’ll want to get like 10 steeps out of it lol.

18ydhhf,kgbo0er,"Why are you framing this primarily as a caffeine question and not a taste question, I guess is the big question. People who resteep do it because they're drinking multiple pots over a day or doing gongfu which is multiple short infusions in a row. If you only want to drink a single pot and are worried about wasting leaf, I'd just consider brewing less leaf for longer.

There's a study that bounces around every once in a while that I believe showed steep to steep the brewed liquid only loses something like 10% of its caffeine content. Enough that it's worth considering, but not enough that I would actually consider tossing the first steep or two to decaffeinate a tea, especially since you also lose a lot of flavor that way.",2,padgettish
18ydhhf,kgc9fj7,"I feel like most of the answers are ignoring the your actual question...

Caffeine is slightly water soluble.  If you are doing a single long steep until your Pureh is black and thick,  you're likely letting it soak long enough that the water is going to take up about as much caffeine that it's going to.

Further steeps will have less flavor and color, but one can expect that there will still be some caffeine left on the leaves for further steeping.  

Normal black tea won't take well to being treated like this and more steeping likely wouldn't be worth the effort; the tea would be weak and the taste may trend towards the bitter.

Pureh will generally (in my experience) be fine with this, so really if you wanted to drink a mug to get your initial hit of caffeine and then just keep topping it off for the rest of the morning to soak up the lingering extra caffeine until you feel it tastes too weak you are likely fine.


If you toss the leaves after 1 long steep, like you are currently doing, and all you care about is the caffeine content, you likely aren't losing enough extra caffeine to feel bad about. But there are cheaper ways to get a hit of caffeine.",2,BlindTreeFrog
18ydhhf,kgdgvq3,"How long it takes to extract ~most~ of the caffeine is going to depend primarily on the leaf size/cut (small leaf particles like tea bags extract more quickly), the temperature of the water throughout the steeping period, and how long you steep. To approximate how much caffeine is left, you could just do a second hot steep, then refrigerate it and drink it the next morning, and see if it feels comparable energy-wise. Or you could refrigerate the leaves and re-steep them the next day.  Source: I’m a scientist but also did a literature review on tea steeping a few years ago for my engineering senior design project 😂

Re-steeping is not limited to pu-erh! I believe any tea can be re-steeped, though how the second (and subsequent) steep turns out will depend on the time/temp of your first extraction. My roommate and I drink white tea gong fu style.",2,eastaly

Then the caffeine also varies based on processing (I believe both the cooking and fermenting of puerh lower caffeine amount).

18ydhhf,kga5u39,"Brewing tea with a teabag (shredded tiny pieces of tea) and full uncut tea leaves is pretty different. 

With a teabag, you're extracting all the flavor at once and leaving basically nothing left. If you try to brew a second cup with it, it'll be tasteless. 

With leaves, you extract a small portion of the flavor with each steep, and that flavor will often change over the course of subsequent steepings.

For puerh, use something like 3-5 grams of tea in a small gaiwan or tea pot. You can do very many short brews of 30 seconds to a minute. For this type of brewing, you're using a larger amount of tea and smaller amount of water and brewing a shorter amount of time than with teabags. If you look up gaiwan brewing there's endless experimentation playing around with these variables to get different results. 

That said, you can absolutely brew puerh more like a typical cup of English black tea, I do this sometimes. About 1 tsp of puerh brewed directly in a cup and you extract it all at once and don't reuse the leaves. 

The tea leaves won't get moldy too quickly, you're fine to leave them in a brewing vessel all day but I wouldn't leave them overnight and use the next day.",28,Hufschmid

The difference in quality of the tea leaves means you can steep it multiple times and retain an enjoyable body and flavour.

It also depends on what you're buying... If I'm buying kukicha, I know I'm getting stems and that's what I'm supposed to get, but if I get a cake of shou and it's half stems, something is wrong there",10,carlos_6m
18yd5yc,kga6o3l,"Some teas definitely have them, as they add sweetness, but they are definitely not as prominent. I think the reason you see less of them, is because they can be seen as filler material to use less leaves.",6,aI3jandro

18yd5yc,kgc56yk,"I don't know the exact reason, but I think it's related to labor available. In China, it's still reasonably easy to get a lot of seasonal labor for the harvest reason (getting more difficult these days), while in Japan you have less seasonal pickers available. I'm not very knowledgable about Japanese tea production, so perhaps more machines are involved in picking.

A lot of stem in Chinese tea is not ok for buying as a gift or even for personal use. Teas with a lot of stem and leftover teas usually are sold to bubble tea stores as they're less demanding with regards to leaf quality.

This said, I do have tried a few Japanese kukicha which are surprisingly decent.",3,Teasenz
18yd5yc,kgborld,"I think you are a bit confused. While in high end rolled Chinese it is looked down on to have many stems (one or two is fine), it's not as frowned on with loose local teas. 
While Japanese have a few cultural superstitions about stems in your tea. So it's more of an acceptable thing. 

Overall though with commercially available teas where mechanical harvesting is done it's seen as trying to cut your product with less valuable tea, versus with hand picked it's seen as human error and acceptable. It's not anywhere as simple as good/bad culturally.",2,quietlywatching6
18yd5yc,kge3ncu,"Kukicha is born out of scarcity. The conditions leading to its consumption in Japan may not have existed in China. For example at one point Japan did not grow its own tea and it had to purchase all of its tea from China. China produces a lot of tea and a lot of very cheap tea. 

Also things sometimes fall out of favour, powdered tea started in China but eventually stopped being produced while it continued to evolve in Japan over centuries. Global demand for matcha flavour is the  only reason green tea powder in China has resumed.",2,DaaiTaoFut

18xtb1x,kgaack5,My wife and I just learned about this recently! It seems to typically be the temperature of the water being too hot. It can also be caused by too much acid. Tea is naturally acidic already some more so than others. The way we’ve solved this is we temp check the steeping tea. We won’t add any cream when the drink is above 150 degrees. We also froth our cream of choice because 1. Who doesn’t like a little milk foam and 2. Frothers will bring the cream temp up gradually to somewhere in the 140-160 range. So now the difference in temperature is minimal enough to prevent curding.

I'm not one of them, but as someone who's baked and gifted cheesecakes to people, this is something I've learned. Cheesecake, and tea are two different texture profiles. Cream cheese is also versatile in that it can be used in many things to give them a tangy, and slightly salty taste, as you mentioned.

Milk is not a homogen mixture, it's a heterogenous mixture that appears homogen. Two main groups of protein are present in milk: whey protein and casein protein. Whey is very soluble in the milk while casein protein clumps together into clusters called micelles (imagine little spheres). The micelles are not as soluble in the milk and have a negative charge on their outside which gives the micelles an even distribution in the milk leading to the ""homogen"" appearance. When the isoelectric point of the milk is reached the negative charges on the micelles are cancelled out by positive charges in the milk and the result is the micelles clumping together or curdling :)",2,Elvthee

Personally, I don't think anyone brews tea the way I like it. So I never expect to have ""the best cup"" outside my house. I'm just grateful to be invited. So don't worry, just enjoy the visit.

My biggest pet peeve with tea in the US is when people throw an old tea bag (that was infused with the aroma of their cupboard) into tap water in a mug and then microwave it. It happens 90% of the time. I'm also frustrated when the cup isn't very clean, which happens more in the UK because more people handwash dishes. I can smell the sponge in the mug. Clean the mugs thoroughly.

It's probably more useful for you to watch some YouTube videos on tea brewing. No need to be fancy. Twinings channel is good enough.

It’s an excuse to break out the tea pot, drink something hot from a tea cup or mug,  and chat about weather/sports/gossip/whatever you want.

White2tea has a lot of affordable cakes and has a pretty good subscription tea club for $30. I've gotten better cakes from them than what my random sampling from Yunnan would of been.

18y27lk,kg94uny,"Can you bring in a cup or some kind and use in the microwave? I have a cup that's kinda like a double size cup because I drink a lot of tea. Lol. I can also use a reusable plastic coffee filter. Since my cup is taller than the filter, I just add the tea leaves to the filter then add faucet water until the filter is nearly submerged but the little handle is still easy to grab. I usually microwave my cup from two to three and a half minutes it varies because of how hot I want the water to be, because I don't always drink the same flavor. Then I just use an old Tupperware lid as a little draining tray for the coffee filter while I add sweetener and milk to my tea (sometimes, but not always).


I lost it in a recent move, but I did have a thermos style (but not fully insulted, so it wasn't a ""real"" thermos lol) big cup meant for soup that worked well for this too.


It might not have a handle, but if you bring a small strong Tupperware style container meant for heating soups for work or school lunches that should work too, even if it's not a real cup. Are you able to bring in a glass measuring cup? Those work great too, but I would add a straw or plastic butter knife or spoon. Water can sometimes over heat (something weird about bubbles having nothing to stick to but then you mostly the cup trying to take it out of the microwave, blah blah blah). Besides, the plastic utensil makes a good stirring device. Lol.


And what tools do you need to make tea? I'm asking because I think I can help you, I just don't know what you have, need, or want.


I mostly work from home now, but I have made lots of tea at workplaces before. So I get it. Tea at work is nice but a pain to make it. Worst comes to worst... rinse out the coffeepot and run it with just am empty filter to catch mineral deposits, and use the machine to make hot water for your cup. I'm pretty sure that there's a coffee machine somewhere. And check your office water cooler thing if you have one. Sometimes they have a second tap for hot water, not just cold water.


Why two cups? Why not one? If I'm using my coffee filter for tea, I use something to catch the drops but it's not required, I just compost my old Tea leaves and letting them dry out a bit helps keep mild down in my compost bin. Thus, a drip tray for the coffee filter.

The roasting process doesn't necessarily add actual smoke, but it can.  The greener version of TGY will be more floral tasting.  Higher oxidized TGY will have more stone-fruit flavors.

18y0zmi,kg83keq,"Yes, this would work. Start with a small amount of tea, less than you think. Loose leaf would be preferable. You can adjust it as you learn what works.

You will see lots of older people doing this in china. In the west, it has acquired the term “grandpa style” thanks mostly to marshaln tea blog. I also use this method at work pretty frequently.",20,eyitsrichard

18y0zmi,kg7zobi,"Your tea would be bitter if you steep for longer than the recommended time. While herbals can go for longer, the longest time for actual tea leaves is about 5 min (at least to my knowledge).

I have a relatively large (maybe medium large?) bottle in terms of what bottles with infusers tend to offer ([19oz](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HRCTB2Z?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1)). You'd need to throw away the leaves after the recommended steeping time and rinse the infuser to prevent the bitterness, but I brew for the whole bottle's worth of water in the morning and keep it with me at work all day. The insulation on that thing is amazing. I would test something like that first, and if you like enough to consistently finish a bottle, you could look into larger solutions.

Or you could get an infuser for your yeti (you might need to hunt for a deeper one, like the one pictured [here](https://www.amazon.com/Vesmoon-Insulated-Water-Bottle-Stainless/dp/B0BLGHFBG6/ref=sr_1_13_sspa?crid=6J68HNO8JCJZ&keywords=tea%2Binfuser%2Blarge&qid=1704335027&sprefix=tea%2Binfuser%2Blar%2Caps%2C149&sr=8-13-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9tdGY&th=1)), but you would need to put in new leaves and hot enough water to brew it each time you refill, then throw the leaves away and rinse the infuser!",1,thecourageofstars

Generally it's best to follow the box directions. If the boxes suggest an amount of water, it tends to be 8oz, but you really don't need to be exact about it. Same for brewing times; unless you're handling something delicate like green tea you can for the most part do 4-5 minutes and you're good.

Teas with sugars and other flavors added are going to mask the tastes of the tea after it's been sitting.

I'm confused by what you mean with this. OP *did* like the way their tea turned out, and they used the temperature most tea experts would recommend as the ""right"" way to make it. The advice to use a lower temperature was unnecessary, unsolicited and bad. 

Experimentation is great, but there are still best-practices in brewing tea. Full flavor extraction needs very hot water. Automatically defaulting to lowering water temperature is a common beginner mistake. It's like training wheels. Yes, it's easier to avoid astringency and bitterness at lower temperatures, but it's not the best way to get the most flavor out of most teas. There are exceptions, but beginners are usually far better off using hotter water and learning to adjust the steep time/leaf quantity.

18xjvpb,kg4k87p,"I am only able to get 4 infusions out of my gyokuro, maybe 5 if I really press it in my kyusu but there is a noticeable drop in flavour.",2,C_Chrono
18xjvpb,kg57dym,"3-4 infusions is pretty standard for most Japanese greens.

120mL is a perfect size for solo sessions with high quality Japanese teas like gyokuro and tencha. No need to get a smaller shiboridashi unless you want to. And why wouldn't you want to? Teaware is awesome! But I wouldn't worry about the loss of space in your pot, that's normal. You're using the right amount of leaf for a kyusu that size.

You are definitely brewing hot for gyokuro, and if it isn't coming out overwhelmingly strong/bitter, then you're probably using a shorter steep time.

In general, Japanese greens are brewed differently than Chinese 'gong fu' teas. Less leaf to water, fewer infusions, and longer steeping times.

However, there is a LOT of variation in how people brew gyokuro. For example, some people will brew it more like sencha, with less leaf and a longer first infusion, and others will use a whole lot of leaf (like 1:1) and do very short infusions. So as long as you are enjoying the final product, that is really all that matters.

If you are looking to start with a good baseline, try this. 4-5g for your 120mL pot. 1st infusion, 60C for 1.5min. 2nd infusion, 60C for 20sec. 3rd infusion, 65C for 40sec. 4th infusion, 70C for 1.5min.

As for gyokuro recommendations, I really like anything from Hibiki-An, and also like trying different teas from Sazen. They both ship from Japan, so I tend to wait till it's time to get a bunch of tea before ordering. Japanese greens do not last a long time like so many other teas, so I only open and drink 1-2 teas at a time. And the rest of the sealed bags go into the fridge for storage.

Hopefully that helps!",1,Outside_Resolve503

After removing the leaves from the pot I'll place the pot in the jug and cover it and let it sit overnight. That way the tea you are seasoning with isn't supper bitter or astringent.",3,callidumnomen

18wt484,kg06vft,"Ah okay.  So here is what I do, maybe this will help.

First, try to sift your tea using a tea sift.  This helps it infuse with the water better.

Put the tea in the bowl, add a small amount of water first.  When mixed with the tea, it should create a deep green color and more of a paste.  Please note when mixing this paste, use the whisk to also whisk or softly scrape the bottom of the bowl.

Make sure all paste is combined with the water well.  Then slowly add the water amount you would like.  (I, personally add maybe 100 -150ml more.  Not very much, but enough)

Last step, use the whisk again to whisk and aerate the tea.  The W motion is exactly right, but try not to scrape the bottom.  We are just whisking the tea now.  Whisk back and forth in a vigorous motion for about 20-30 seconds.  Carefully remove the whisk and you should have matcha with a nice foam.",16,MaShinKotoKai

May also be sacrilege, but one of those battery powered mixers can work fairly well too when you're not in the mood to whisk.",3,Global_Lock_2049

Steamed leaves smelled like some sort of fruit chocolate truffle. Promising start to the session.

Raspberries on the nose with notes of dark chocolate.
Palate had that nice fruit and maybe a hint of bakers chocolate.
Mouthfeel started out somewhat silky.
Finish had an enjoyable sweetness to it that lingered, particularly around the lips.

Nose and palate fruit gained intensity on 8th infusion and chocolate faded away. Sweetness also increased.
There was also a floral note present throughout the session that I couldn’t quite decode.
Mouthfeel thickened pleasantly as session went on.

This tea just kept getting better as the session wore on. Definitely showed good complexity and longevity.

Fruit evolved to cherries near end of the session. Excellent!

Did first to last comparisons. 2nd infusion was very much that raspberry chocolate mix. 2nd to last was very rounded full of cherries. 1st infusion had aromas similar to Scotch or maybe brandy while palate was dominated by the dark chocolate. Last infusion was like some sort of cherry liqueur in a good way. The evolution of this tea during the session was really good.

I will definitely buy more of this tea in the future and this has me looking forward to the other teas I ordered from Tea Vivre. I highly recommend it. Another great session from start to finish.",3,DevOpsProDude

18wv5a1,kg1ogw2,I asked the same question last year. Interesting that the idea that the caffeine washes off in seconds is such a widespread myth,1,Honey-and-Venom
18wv5a1,kg2rtgg,"I used to believe 80% of the caffeine would be released in the first steep. Turns out this was a myth.  Someone posted an actual scientific paper and they actually had measured caffeine and it is pretty consistent each steeping. It's just the water temp over time.

These webpages also link to the respective studies, TL;DR for those curious.

https://happyearthtea.com/blogs/tea-101-about-tea/can-caffeine-be-rinsed-from-tea

The results that emerged from the study were as follows.

Time	|Caffeine Removed	|Avg percent per minute	
30 seconds	|9%	|18% / min	
1 minute	|18%	|18% / min	
2 minutes	|34%	|16% / min	
3 minutes	|48%	|16% / min	
4 minutes	|60%	|15% / min	
5 minutes	|69%	|14% / min	
10 minutes	|92%	|9% / min	
15 minutes	|100%	|6% / min	https://www.divinitea.com/caffeine-level-second-steeping/

According to a study by Dr. Bruce Branan, Professor of Chemistry at Asbury College (Wilmore, KY), it takes a three-minute infusion just to remove 46-70% of the caffeine from a cup of tea.

In the end, no, I think 1-2 rinses would remove much caffeine.


Edit: I went through the other article linked in another comment, very good article.

https://chadao.blogspot.com/2008/02/caffeine-and-tea-myth-and-reality.html

It discussed something like 20% caffeine removal at 30sec and 33% at 1min, and they noted that that was for crushed up tea, stirred vigorously, ""rather than the 9% yielded with traditional steeping""

I thought this was a good point: While Caffeine can vary by tea type, it is really about the bush and season and not the fact that it is black or green.

18wnkfd,kfys2qa,"X-posted from /r/puer. 

Grabbed a bunch of tea from hometown market

I know supermarket quality can be hit or miss for puerh in particular. Smelling through the papers, all but one cake smell great, and even that one smells decent. The jars are more mixed quality (detailed reviews below), generally far better than I expected for the price, but a couple total duds.

I’d love to buy nicer cakes for sure, but I could get these with EBT/SNAP, and as a grad student, I’ll take adequate over nothing. 

**Does anybody know if anything I have here in the cakes punches above the “$8-12 grocery store find” weight class? Or have any info on these teas at all?**

Some of the loose teas, I’ve sampled (or tossed) prior to posting, the rest I drank yesterday and today, so here are some thoughts on the haul. Cake details TBD, I suppose! Excited to crack into those because previously, I’ve just ordered samples on and off, mostly from Yunnan Sourcing, or I’d get decent shou when visiting my local tea and coffee spot. So, this is a turning point for my puerh enthusiasm, and I know there are a couple gems like the Menghai or the CNNP, but I don’t know if anything else is really worthwhile. 


Moving from left to right, top to bottom:

- The red tin is labeled Tie Guan Yin. I wasn’t familiar with Tieguanyin, so I didn’t know what it was when I picked it up, I just liked the packaging and price point. **It’s a really nice oolong!** The only description beyond Tie Guan Yin is the text “high quality selection, tasteful gift.” There’s not even importer or origin information on here. The sticker MAYBE says Blooming Greens Inc, but the font is too small and the sticker is reflective, so it’s hard to tell. If you see it, it’s worth the $12ish gamble.

- The next two jars are glass jars with well-sealing lids. These were $10 or slightly more than that. Both are good for the price. Easy daily drinkers. One is oolong and the other is puer. Both are DMD Bridge Brand. Neither gives much information about the tea itself other than the generic name. Import/production information is given as: A product of Hong Kong Jiaxing Trading Co Ltd. 
  - Oolong: my wife has a great palate and is the cheapest woman I know; she said this was a solid purchase. Google machine translate tells me that it says Taiwan Oolong somewhere on the back label, while in English it just says Oolong Tea, as well as giving import and nutrition info.
  - Pu Er: it’s labeled aged puerh; I think that means it’s an aged sheng, but one of you should correct me on that if I’m wrong to assume so. No other information is given beyond the back listing it, per Google machine translation, as “special grade puer tea.” Not a wild tea by any means. Black tea aroma, some woodland musk. Brews the same way. Three decent steeps (30-60 seconds each) and then a couple less characterful ones. I’ll try flash steeping next time to see if that gets me more mileage. 

- I mentioned in the OP that the one container was a total waste. It was also “DMD Bridge brand Aged Pu Er Tea.” But in a lower quality plastic container with shrink wrap around the plastic screwtop lid. It just smelled like mildew and dirty laundry. No discernible scent of tea. No good aromas, no good funk. I like rich puerhs and I also enjoy drinking beers like true lambic or geueze, so I don’t shy from funky, earthy, “unconventional” flavors; this wasn’t that. Didn’t even brew it. Just dumped the contents and recycled the jar (which smells strongly like the tea even after bleaching; I considered using it for tea storage until the aroma wouldn’t dissipate). 

- paperboard canister labeled Yunnan Pu Er Tea. Golden Bridge Brand. Distributed by JNL(USA) Int’l Inc of Diamond Bar, California. Ten dollars well spent. Black tea, mushroom-like (almost like opening a package of dried shiitake), woody, almost a hint of black pepper. Flavor dissipates after just 2-4 brews, but oh well. Since I’m new to brewing puer at home, I don’t know nearly enough to tell if this is shou or sheng. 

- cardboard canister of “High Mountain Oolong Tea” distributed by Wei-Chuan USA. This was another great $10 spent. My wife enjoyed it and will make this one her daily drinker. My kids also liked it! I liked it but didn’t drink enough to give thoughtful feedback beyond very floral and a tiny bit grassy. The label advertises 8-10 steeps, and that’s about what I got out of it. No real information on source. The canister says, quite nicely (per Google machine translation): 
> The spirit of tea that has lasted for hundreds of years is still repeating the voice of praise. For thousands of years, the tea garden of the shop is unfolding a transparent and flexible artistic picture. Clear water, clear waves, leaping fish, fishermen, shadows of willows on the dike.

- the brown tin (top right), Ronshing puerh, is another total waste. Also smells only like mildew and rot. No tea aroma, no redeemable character. Brewed with the same aroma. Didn’t end up drinking it. My wife hated the smell. My kids hated the smell. My cats probably even hated the smell. 

- Dragon Balls. Pu’er Tea. Might **also** be Blooming Greens Inc. (brand possibly indicated on aforementioned red tin), but logo font is too small to tell here too. Each ball is 7.7 g, based on weighing a sample of 5. 27 balls in a $5ish plastic container. Smelled like generic puer when brewed. Nothing too funky. Nothing too notable. Dull flavor after the first steep. Probably wouldn’t buy again but glad to have tried. Back label says the following (in Roman/English letters) under nutrition information:
> Wellworth inc
> xiang gang zhan jun huan qiu you xian gong si

- Hazo Pu Er Tea. Horng Yih Tea Factory Co., Taiwan. A perfectly adequate, inoffensive puer in a nice tin. Only get a couple good brews out of it. Earthy, a little woody spice. By fifth steep, it tastes like cardboard with a hint of puer.",8,ShiitakeFriedClams

Could you point to some examples? I'd love to take a look. I find it really interesting how design has changed over the decades.

This year while getting out Christmas ornaments, I noticed a box with ornaments from my dad's childhood. It was for stockings or something like that, probably from some time in the 60s, and I was struck by how elegant and minimalist the design on the box looked. It was surprisingly modern looking and it honestly looked better than a lot of packaging I see today",1,papayahog
18w1bf8,kg7u352,"As for your dad's old box, your observation is so right. Packaging from that era was remarkably, uniquely beautiful – elegant, vibrant, amusing, intriguing – and it was mainly all done by hand. I'm not sure why fonts, colors, designs and drawing styles reached such a peak around 1959, and I'm not an art-history scholar, but I swear it's true. Art styles, design concepts, patterns, furniture and fonts grew deliberately looser, sloppier, less lifelike, more abstract and ""mod"" during the 1960s as artists pursued more wild, shocking effects. As a tiny child, I disliked these changes to the degree that my little mind could perceive them.

Gooseneck: I will never go back to non-gooseneck after having these (Had one at work too when I used to have to go in to the office). Pouring is so easy to control both flowrate and exactly where you're pouring with absolutely no splash. 

Temperature hold: If you're like me and wander off, this is pretty huge. 

Heating element under the base. I think this is standard now, but old ones used to have a heating element in the water that would become corroded really fast.

No plastic touching the water. This isn't huge, but hot plastic isn't great for you, and so many options out there don't have plastic touching the water, so why bother?

I would prefer to have either a dial or touch buttons to set temperature. My current one you have to cycle through the temps and it's annoying especially since my wife tends to use the temp one up from the one I like (so she hits it once to get to hers, I then hit it 5 times to cycle back to mine) - but if budget was a huge factor I'd overlook this.

Last thing would be going over reviews: Is rust an issue? Do they last? I always go to 3 star reviews on amazon for the most useful information. Then 1 and 2 stars, but they tend to be dramatic. 5 star reviews I usually just glance at.

18wcqhy,kfwy3du,"My husband and I drink tea on the daily, but we also love to mark special occasions with afternoon high tea services, such as anniversaries, birthdays, etc. We had also started a tradition of high tea to celebrate New Year's, reflecting on the year passed and upcoming goals and plans. This year, we were unable to go out to a teahouse due to our new 3-month old daughter, so I decided to put together afternoon tea at home for us. Husband had gifted me a tea set from Wedgwood as I told him I daydreamed of having tea parties with our daughter someday. The dream is coming true. I am so excited to include our daughter in this annual tradition. 

Do you have any tea traditions?",22,pfenefer
18wcqhy,kfy8frn,"The tea traditions in my heritage (Malaysian Chinese) is the Chinese tea ceremony during weddings.

The Malaysians word of tea is ‘teh’ which is taken from Hokkien dialect spoken in province of Fujian, China. However, Cantonese happens to be spoken widely in Kuala Lumpur. Cantonese is also a Chinese dialect and here tea is known as ‘cha’.

There are a couple of tea’s which the Malaysians love to drink and among them are the ‘the tarik’ which translates to ‘pulled tea’ and ‘teh o ais’ which means sweet black iced tea.

‘Tehtarik’ this is the most famous variation of tea which is available across Malaysia. The Malaysian street has many kopitiam’s or coffee shops. People come here to enjoy ‘tehtarik’ with snacks or meals. Besides the kopitiam there are ‘mamaks’ which are local tea shops and offer twenty four hour service. ‘Mamaks’ are famous for local gatherings.

Malaysia has a blend of Western and Chinese tea drinking cultures which have delve deep in their culture. It reflects Malaysia as a multi-cultural society.

The most important beverage which is enjoyed by all the Malaysians is the ‘tehtarik’.

The ‘tehtarik’ is prepared by adding condensed milk to a brew of strong black tea. The condensed milk is sometimes mixed with hot milk also. This mixture is poured from a height back and forth which creates sweet froth on top of the tea. Besides helping to mix the tea and condensed milk the tea also cools down and is brought down to a temperature which is just right for drinking.
There are many competitions held in Malaysia where experts come and display their techniques of pouring ‘tehtarik’. They whip milk through the air and go as high as possible displaying various techniques of pouring it.

The ‘tehtarik’ originated from the Indian Muslim immigrants who were staying in the Malay Peninsula. They set up stalls in front of the rubber plantations after the World War II. The workers drank this tea as refreshment. Serving ‘tehtarik’ with ‘roti canai’ is very famous in Malaysia. It is a sort of breakfast which is quite popular.

Besides the ‘tehtarik’ which is prepared by adding milk to it the other version which is quite popular is the ‘teh o ais’. There is no tea added in this type of tea and is had cold.

The ‘teh o ais’ prepared by steeping a tea bag or some tea leaves in hot water for about 30 seconds. To this liquid sugar syrup and some lime juice is added and finally it is topped with some ice. This is a refreshing drink and is loved by the Malaysians. They usually have it in the late afternoons.",4,Curious_Koala_312

And don’t get me wrong, lower quality isn’t a judgement. I am having a fantastic time tasting a lot of high quality teas, but my bedrock is cheap, low quality CTC Scottish morn from Harney and Sons. I wake up every morning with that cup and then later in the day, I’ll try something more nuanced.

One of my favorite teas in the morning is Harney’s Titanic blend which has “Formosa” oolong in the blend. I liked it so much that I got some “Formosa” oolong from them. Let’s just say, it’s much better in a blend than by itself. Ok, let’s restate it, I hated it by itself.

There are high quality teas that I hate, and I drink a cup of low quality tea every single day because it’s my absolute favorite. However, “Formosa” isn’t a specific type of oolong. It’s a term used as a catch all for the lower quality Taiwanese oolong.",2,medicated_in_PHL

18wtnus,kfzypx0,"I could be wording this way wrong, but from what I can tell, you'd be looking for English Breakfast tea (which might be the more popular term if you're looking for it on sale, at least in the US). While you can use both terms for the same tea that is typically used in boba stores, [orange peoke seems to be a grading system more than the actual type of tea](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3i5gvj/eli5_what_is_the_difference_between_orange_pekoe/). It's definitely become one of my favorites with milk and sugar precisely because it reminds me of boba!

Generally speaking, loose leaf teas will give you better quality. The tea leaves aren't grinded down in a way that reduces taste, and a huge part of extracting flavor in the brewing process is allowing for tea leaves to expand. Typically, tea in tea bags (at least your usual grocery store kind, like Lipton) is grinded/cut (?) down to a strange dust where there isn't as much of the flavor left. It might also have other dirt particles since it's harder to separate when the leaf isn't intact.

You don't have to get a bag this big like I do, but I get bags like [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000SARJF6?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1). If you grab the loose leaf version and some kind of tea infuser (could be something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Yoassi-Extra-Fine-Approved-Stainless/dp/B01LQ7NQTW/ref=sxin_14_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa?content-id=amzn1.sym.d17ca69f-1a39-4f7d-a62f-e5dff4cfd6d8%3Aamzn1.sym.d17ca69f-1a39-4f7d-a62f-e5dff4cfd6d8&crid=1HSQKXFRBSHDO&cv_ct_cx=tea+infuser&keywords=tea+infuser&pd_rd_i=B01LQ7NQTW&pd_rd_r=dead0ca5-6ff0-476f-9502-918a1e066dd3&pd_rd_w=3Ayiy&pd_rd_wg=W8QTO&pf_rd_p=d17ca69f-1a39-4f7d-a62f-e5dff4cfd6d8&pf_rd_r=KCYM3EADH3496D6QPMEJ&qid=1704214925&s=grocery&sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&sprefix=tea+infuse%2Cgrocery%2C164&sr=1-2-364cf978-ce2a-480a-9bb0-bdb96faa0f61-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9zZWFyY2hfdGhlbWF0aWM&psc=1), or [this](https://www.amazon.com/Reinmoson-Strainers-Infuser-Stainless-Threaded/dp/B0B5ZTZL6G/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1HSQKXFRBSHDO&keywords=tea%2Binfuser&qid=1704214925&s=grocery&sprefix=tea%2Binfuse%2Cgrocery%2C164&sr=1-4&th=1), I'm certain you'll find many more designs for it), I think you'll find a much higher quality of tea! You could also make it in a teapot or a larger container like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Tealyra-rapidTEA-30-ounce-Dispensing-Guarantee/dp/B01HDZFPSQ/ref=sr_1_15_sspa?crid=1HSQKXFRBSHDO&keywords=tea%2Binfuser&qid=1704214925&s=grocery&sprefix=tea%2Binfuse%2Cgrocery%2C164&sr=1-15-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9tdGY&th=1), but I find the smaller metal infusers are the simplest (in terms of cleaning) and most beginner friendly. :)

If you're ever curious about how different the loose leaf tea is from the bagged one, you can take a tea bag, cut it open, and take a look inside and compare! For the loose leaf version, personally, I do one teaspoon per 200ml. It'll seem like very little, but the leaves will expand a lot!",5,thecourageofstars

Nose was a mix of lemon grass, florality, and vegetal notes to start.
Palate was quite nice with note akin to mix of apples and pears and just a little hint of uncooked vegetables.
Mouthfeel was silky smooth.
Tasty pears on the finish.

Lemon zest entered into the palate on the 5th or 6th infusion.
Mouthfeel was excellent when the tea cooled a bit.
Lemon note dominated nose on 8th infusion. 
A nice astringency also came into the picture at this infusion.

Did first to last comparison. 2nd infusion had much more of that fresh vegetable note and a little briskness. 2nd to last was rounded and sweet without any vegetation notes. 1st was very light and last was mellow but still had that excellent mouthfeel.

This was an excellent tea nearly from start to finish. It was well balanced with a wonderful flavor profile, mouthfeel, good finish, and great longevity.

Let me tell you, it was a pure heaven to drink. It was the first quality loose leaf tea I had ever tasted and it started my journey of discovering various types of tea. Also I can't stand teabags tea with the occasional exception of fruit / herbal tissanes ever since. My all time favorite dragon well is Long Jing Shi Feng, as it has sweet chestnut like roasted taste I would kill for.

We'd forgotten about it earlier, so we were deciding who was going to drag the cans down our very long driveway in the cold. I offered to make hot cocoa, using fancy baking cocoa and such. I ran the machine while he took the cans out. He's not much of a tea drinker lol. I sat and started sipping my tea. It took me a moment to figure out why my tea was off. It was yummy, but not quite right...


Turned out, id made a hot cocoa mix right on top of my Russian caravan leaves. It made a mess out of my reusable filter, but it was pretty yummy. Now I do it on purpose at times, but use a paper filter. 😂


For a summer or lighter tea, I adore celestial seasonings ""mandarin orange spice"" with a drop or two of orange blossom honey to boost the orange goodness without adding too much sweetness to it.


I also adore that pink tea something I get at a local Indian restaurant. I usually get two cups of tea right when I get there, because it takes a few minutes to make. Yummy though. Lol.


I also love chai tea (I know that ""chai"" means tea so I'm really saying ""tea tea"" but I do it because I find it amusing to say ""tea tea"" lol).

Dont be mislead there’s plenty of bad Darjeeling too. There’s also a second third and fourth flush in Chinese tea which also has its own subtleties. Not to mention the growing regions are much more diverse in Yunnan as the many regions equate to many different unique profiles as well. Not to mention the many different ways puer can be processed which adds to even more diversity. There’s also a ton of other provinces in China that produce tea different than yunnan puer. These also have different villages who produce tea in their own other ways. U must have not spent enough time on this sub. Most of the conversation here is tea bags and the like. But even so there’s plenty of discussion about Chinese, Indian, and Japanese tea. There’s really no echo chamber or tunnel vision that u speak of. Most of the talk here is very surface level anyway. Additionally, I can’t help that China produces the most tea out of any other country nor can I help that it’s the most popular (and for good reason) there’s far far more diversity in Chinese tea and limiting urself to one tea probably won’t help u understand much anything about tea as a whole.",8,user987632

And if ur talking about how I said they produce the most and are most popular, that’s just numbers based. And Maybe the other ones aren’t talked about because they’re either not as good or not as popular. It’s very simple. U seem to have forgotten my original comment was merely clearing up a misconception u demonstrated which u then responded with some rant and continue to do. I also mentioned more than just puer when I talked about different provinces. So yes Chinese tea is vastly more diverse than Darjeeling. There’s hundreds of Chinese teas. Also I don’t think your 3 years of food fermenting makes u an expert on the many years and history of tea fermenting.

18wj3id,kg1ajfc,"There are teas that are naturally sweet with no sugar at all. Look for teas with lots of cinnamon - like Harney & Sons Hot Cinnamon Spice or Market Spice’s Cinnamon Orange. 

Another option would be teas with hibiscus. Hibiscus is tart and sweet - excellent on its own, but I like it with other flavors. Lemon Zinger by Celestial Seasonings is an old standby. Tao of Tea’s Hibiscus Ginger is great. 

Licorice is another ingredient that adds natural sweetness to teas. I don’t have any to recommend, but you could keep an eye out for it in ingredients. 

I loathe stevia, monk fruit et al, so I’d rather have no sweetener than have these. I had to stop buying David’s Tea blends because they put stevia in so many of them.

Basic chemistry dictates that pure, organic essential oils cannot be harmful, if the base plant matter that they were extracted from is not harmful.

Worst case scenario you could get one or two smart kettles and wait for technology to catch up to you. You can set temperatures a few minutes early and it's waiting for you when you're ready. If you and your wife are drinking different types of tea you could each have your own kettle which would also speed up the heating process.

I start from 80c, 3gr, 70ml, 60 seconds and adjust from there. The 3gr/70ml ratio is mostly constant, but some senchas prefer 70c, others 80c. Infusion time also varies from 60 to 90 seconds.

Brew tea like an Englishmen

On boiling the water

Cold water. Boil it once. Pour immediately into a teapot (If you are making tea for just yourself a mug is acceptable) Left over water in the kettle from last time? Throw that shit away.

On Teapots

This is never cleaned.
* Your friend thinks it would be a great idea to make cocktails in it? Throw it away.
* Sick in it? Throw it away
* Cleaned with anything other than just hot water? Throw it away.
Your teapot should have a tea cosy, it is frowned upon if this is not chequered or floral. Bonus points if it matches your tea towels.
Regarding the tea cosy: it is entirely acceptable, if not required, that you put it on your head and refer yourself as the Bishop. (Thanks to iamtheparty) As pointed out 'warming the pot' is a common practice whereby a small amount of boiled water is added to the tea prior to the teabags and swirled around. This is to make sure the tea is piping hot. In my opinion this is not strictly necessary but comes under the banner of 'cocking about'.

On Mugs

Teacups and saucers are only used to impress people that you do not want to come to your house. Use a mug. Mugs should be large, clean and most importantly yours * Not your Dad's * Not one that you found at the back of the cupboard at your office kitchen, even if it is the only one that does not smell like off milk. * It must be your own mug. There are many like it but this one is yours. You do not use it at 3am when you feel the need for bathroom tap water. You do not use it to keep your stationary in. You do not permit anyone else to use it. This mug is for tea and tea alone.

On Brands of Tea

Most people have a preference to which tea brand they like. Personally I'm a big fan of Yorkshire tea. PG tips, in my opinion, are of the devil. If someone were to hand me a cup of it, I would drink it. I'm British anything else would be impolite. We will cover etiquette later. Students Red label tea from Sainsbury's is fantastic for its cost.
On Tea Leaves
Some people have got the time to make loose leaf tea. Well done you. How was art school? I also like loose leaf tea. I drink it when I have nothing better to do or am at a tea shop and have the leisure time to deal with loose leaf. On the whole though, teabags will suffice. Yes they will. Stop it.

On Brewing

One teabag per person and one for the pot. Do not deviate from this method. You do not know better. Again taste varies for the strength of your tea. It is vital, VITAL that you do not over brew the tea. Some of the naturally stronger teas like Yorkshire should not be brewed for long as they will become bitter.
* Don't go and have a piss.
* Don't go and chat up that lovely bird in Finance.
* Don't play Angry Birds.
* STAY. THE. FUCK. THERE.
If you have used a teapot, after a minute use a spoon to stir a few times. Brewing time should be around 4 minutes. Pour a little out into your mug to check the strength. If it is the colour of a dark ale such as Otter then the tea is at a good strength. If you have used a mug stirring regularly is fine. A good indicator of when your tea has reached a good strength is that you can only see the top 1/2 inch of the teabag due to the darkness of your beverage.

On Milk

People vary in their taste for strong tea. While brewing strength is important milk will also lower the strength of your tea. Add it slowly, preferably from a small jug rather than from an ungainly 6 pint milk bottle. You do not want to make a mess, that would be unseemly. Some people say that you must add milk first before adding tea. Some people also believe that pluto isn't a planet. Fuck those people. I have found that it makes very little difference. Much in the same way that if you were dropped into hot liquid you would scream the same amount as if you had boiling liquid poured onto you.

On Sugar

This component is widely debated. Some will take enough sugar to cause diabetes within a two mile radius. The great undecided populous will take somewhere between the most infuriating of measures (just a little bit) and what they call 3 teaspoons, which, due to the ever changing laws of science could mean practically any amount. Those enlightened few will ask for no sugar. This, apart from being a lot easier to measure, is also the most refreshing way to enjoy tea. I have yet to come across anyone who drinks tea with sugar to be anything less than abhorrent. Of course I say all this in jest. Drink tea as you like it. I would encourage you to try it without sugar for one week. If you remain stoically unaffected then you may return to your faux tea with my faux blessing. There is an exception. If someone has just heard some distressing news (like their aunt has just been severely injured by a swan), then sweet tea is the most appropriate prescription. Also, if you are an OAP, you are allowed to drink tea as sweet as you like with complete impunity. (Thanks Anon_is_a_Meme)

On Biscuits

Digestives or hobnobs. Rich teas are a sick joke and are a trap for those of you who dunk biscuits in your tea. If you must have chocolate coated biscuits then choose a dark chocolate variety, these will leave less chocolate on your fingers.

On Etiquette
* Tea is a social drink, before you make it enquire as to whether anyone else would like one in the vicinity.
* Drink at your leisure, coffee is for abusing when deadlines approach
* Biscuits should be served on a side plate
* If you make any mess while making tea clear up after yourself
* It is always best to throw any boiled water and any unused tea away after using the kettle and teapot

I have some teas I'll steep for 5-8 times, and I have some that can be steeped for 20-30 times. It's just about when the tea stops being nice to you.

I don't usually throw away the rinse anymore, but if you want to, I'd only steep for 30 seconds on the first go.",8,Rataridicta
18vs7kj,kfu23bt,"this is entirely dependent on brewing parameters!

I don't really use increasing brewing times the way I used to; just kinda do it by feel now. Brewing time for these particular teas grows to about \~1 min per infusion for the later infusions.

There must be other sites with sampler sets, but I don't know any.  Generally speaking, spring pluck (post winter harvest)  in oolongs is the best.  there also is a subreddit for puer.",3,Dragonfly-danser
18vw3pf,kfveqd4,"I have some experience with Puers, though I'm by no means an expert. I could offer some suggestions, but I'm not sure what you're looking for: do you know about/have interest in ripe (shou) vs. raw (sheng)? Does one or the other flavor profile sound more interesting? You can find Puer that isn't terribly expensive. Kurra Corp is in Australia (in Melbourne, as i recall). I'd start by looking at their site if you are interested in exploring it.

If you've not done so, the other major category to explore is oolong, of course (though I've also never met a yellow or white tea I've disliked). This is a category I'm only sort of familiar with, but it's extraordinarily varied; e.g., there are significant variations in growing conditions (mountain oolongs, etc.), oxidation levels (with some being quite dark and others closer to green), and roasted vs. unroasted. You could look into Dancongs and Yanchas (note: this is quite a rabbit hole). There are also some outstanding Taiwanese oolongs (I rather like dong dings, but as I said, I'm no expert in this category.",2,menenius_agrippa
18vw3pf,kfw84c0,"I'm also in Australia and don't really like bitter flavours. I started getting into puer in November and really love sheng (raw) puer. Specifically from white2tea - there are so many interesting flavours in sheng from nuttiness to candied pears, it's been such a treat! I've also got tea from bitterleaf who also ships from China, and KuuraCorp who ship out of Melbourne but I'm yet to break into those teas.

If youre really looking for sweet, white2tea's white tea Dian Mei tastes exactly like fruit loops to me.

Shipping from tea vendors in China is generally pretty reasonable (some do free shipping over a certain spend amount) as long as you're willing to wait a couple weeks for them to arrive.",2,slightly_anxious22

18vw3pf,kfw8ia4,"Just to add, KuuraCorp has black tea cakes that are really yummy (I've only had the Recombinator) if you're interested in trying pressed cake tea that is typical of puer and white tea while still trying a more familiar taste!",2,slightly_anxious22
18vw3pf,kfytbb2,Cheers ^_^. I'll check out White2Tea. If you're a fan of sweet teas too might I suggest a few teas from The Tea Centre. Two I'd highly recommend are Turkish Delight and Monk. The Monk tea is aaammaazinngg! My all time no.1,2,Bubbles_JG
18vw3pf,kfz8l1p,"As with all things tea, it's a bit difficult to generalize. Black teas, for instance range from the heavily astringent ctc Kenyan teas (many of which are designed to be taken with milk and sugar) to light/delicate first flush Darjeelings to the highly fruity/malty teas you can sometimes get from wild trees in Yunnan (and I'm skipping over a whole bunch). 

So too with white teas, and frankly, all other teas too. As an agricultural product, tea is exceedingly variable, with different varietals, in different growing conditions that vary from year to year, all producing very different effects. The result is that it's often hard to generalize; there will always be exceptions. 

Anyway, as to white teas: Many (e.g., silver needles) are quite sweet (usually in a floral sense) and delicate. Moonlight teas (sometimes pressed into cakes) have a lovely melon-note to them (or at least, that's how I'd describe it), usually combined with a thicker body. I'm also a big fan of Nan Mei (wild tea buds); they have a flamboyant fragrance, a good herbacious and perhaps even citrusy flavor.

Yellow teas, by the way, are somewhat similar to greens. My understanding--and I must emphasize, I'm not the person to ask about the details of tea production!--is that yellow teas go through an added step. The leaves are wrapped in a cloth and gently steamed. This allows the leaves to ""yellow"" (become mildly oxidized) before it is then dried, usually over charcoal. The result, to my taste buds, is everything I like about good green teas, but with added richness and body",2,menenius_agrippa
18vw3pf,kg4edw5,"Awesome, thankyou! White teas sound wonderful. I'll have to give one a try next time I go tea shopping.",1,Bubbles_JG

I can't vouch for it directly--I've not bought from them before. But people I trust have recommended it. It's also an interesting selection, hitting all of the major types of tea. 

One final note: if you're going to explore these various types of tea, I'd also recommend getting a gaiwan and looking up how to do gong-fu brewing. It's different from ""western style"" brewing: Western style brewing uses a high water to leaf ratio and then steeps for (relatively) long periods of time. Gong fu brewing uses a much lower water to leaf ratio with short steeps. Western brewing works well for certain teas--e.g., black teas that you intend to add milk and sugar to. But gong fu brewing works well for others, especially for bringing out the nuances and delicate notes of teas.",1,menenius_agrippa

This orchid oolong, also known as Phoenix Dancong, is a high mountain oolong grown in the Phoenix Mountains in Southern China.

Legend has it that while passing through the Phoenix Mountains, an emperor of the Song Dynasty ordered his guards to pick some tea leaves that resembled bird's beaks to make tea. After drinking it, the emperor felt soothed and refreshed. So great was his appreciation of the tea that he henceforth named the tea - Tea of the Emperor - Song Tea (宋茶). This particular type of tea has been cultivated in this area since then and is widely known throughout China. The tea is golden yellow and clear, and carries the fragrance of flowers and honey.

To thank our tea lovers, please use code ""WELCOME2024"" for 20% off [sitewide](https://www.lifianatural.com/shop) from now till Lunar new year. Hope a cup of warm tea bring you joy and peace.

Relax, your tea is here.

18vvu3v,kfxr1zn,"Hello everyone!  
  
The time has come for our year-end event. We have been doing this together now for six years, half way around the zodiac, and we have a lot of good stuff on offer to celebrate this milestone. This year we are doing a raffle, rolling out five new products, and finally launching a our rewards program.   
  
First let’s talk about the **raffle**. Between January 1st and January 3rd, three lucky people who make an order over 100 USD will win one of the following:   
**100ml Wood-fired Easy Gaiwan**  
**100g pressing of the (Huazhuliangzi Gushu) Tree Spirit**  
**200g White Dew Shoumei Cake**  
  
All of these products are unique in one way. This is the last time One River Tea will be offering an Easy Gaiwan, and it is really the last hurrah of our teaware. We only have one left and when it is gone it is gone. This Tree Spirit Puer Cake is also one a kind - we only ever made one at this size and it will absolutely be gone after this raffle. Finally, this is the first time we are selling the popular 2022 White Dew Shoumei in its “Modern Nuwa” tea cake form. Three different people will receive an email on January 4th to let them know they have won the raffle and get one of these three freebies in their order.  
  
You all will have extra reason reason to drop $100 those three days with our brand new releases. Besides the Modern Nuwa Cake, we will also be releasing two new Yanchas, a red tea, and a dark tea.  
  
Although our existing line-up of affordable Yancha has been one of our best selling sections of the store, a core demographic of customers has also cried out for higher grade Wuyi Oolong selections. If you are one of those people, our brand new [Winter Daphne](https://onerivertea.com/collections/new-releases/products/winter-daphne) and [Blue Ribbon Red Robe](https://onerivertea.com/collections/new-releases/products/blue-ribbon-red-robe) are for you. The former is heavy roasted but delicate addition to our yancha line-up, while the latter is an award winning blended Red Robe that is a real step up from your normal daily drinker. 

  
There are two other heavily requested teas from Central China that are also going to drop on January 1st: [Old Path Yihong](https://onerivertea.com/collections/new-releases/products/old-path-yihong) and [2017 Anhua Dark](https://onerivertea.com/collections/new-releases/products/2017-wild-harvest-anhua-heicha). The former has been a favorite of ours to gift out, was included in the Summer red tea sampler, and is a chocolaty medium oxidized red tea that is perfect for this season; the latter was the dark tea sample many of you enjoyed from the Black Friday Sale, and is a wonderfully mellow representative of the new, more boutique styles of Heicha that are developing in the region. We will be in Anhua when the event drops to share more about this style, the producer, and the region.  
  
If the raffle, brand new tea, and the coming shipping slowdown as we approach Chinese New Year are not all reason enough to buy, we are also going to roll out our new **rewards program** this January 1st. We rely on repeat customers to keep this project viable, and many other vendors already have similar programs. Starting January 1st, you will receive three “**co-op coins**” for every dollar you spend, which you can later use on future purchases. 60 coins can be redeemed for a single dollar, meaning for every 20 dollars you spend, you get one back. Between January 1st and 3rd，everyone will receive double coins, meaning one dollar back for ever ten spent.   
  
P.S. Customers that refer a friend will get a five dollar coupon, as will the new friend they have referred to us. Also Join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/BbP747e3c5).

18vj6wm,kfrf4xi,"Brewed Gong Fu style. 3 g tea to 45ish ml water at 212 F. Gaiwan, cha hai, cup warmed. Tea steamed. 5 seconds, 10 s, 15 s, 20 s, 25 s, 30 s, 35 s, 45 s, 1 minute, 2 m, 5 m, 10 m

Camphor dominated the nose with a little humidity note.
Palate was light with camphor and sweetness. A little bit of huigan.
Finish started off light.
Good silky mouthfeel.

This was another “toothpaste” tea. Not my favorite flavor profile, but it is fun.

Nose was still camphor and wet woods on 10th infusion.
Light sweetness crept into finish as session went on.

Compared 2nd infusion with next to last. 2nd didn’t have much nose, but had a little bitterness to the palate. 2nd to last was more mellow and rounded.
1st infusion almost tasted like Scotch. Last was very light, thick and mellow, demonstrating the leaves had little left to give.

I really should have done a side by sids with this tea and the 2010 Liu Bao EOT provided in this month’s club shipment to see if it demonstrated the effects of aging for that long. Maybe some other time.

I personally wouldn’t seek more of this tea, just because of the flavor profile, but it is fun and enjoyable for what it is.",7,DevOpsProDude

18vfdnl,kfta01w,"This one and most others like it are enameled inside. It's a layer of glass. 

For non-enameled cast iron:

Not in the same sense as pans. You don't want polymerized oil in your tea. People reccomend ""seasoning"" them with black tea, but I'm not sure if there's any real science behind that. You're mostly relying on the metal being hot enough to evaporate any water left behind once you're finished with it. You don't want to leave them sitting with liquid in them.",2,Fishdude94
18vfdnl,kft9tu1,"OP left out one of the most important parts... Preheat it! Not on the oven (the enamel will separate from the iron), but fill it with hot water, swirl it around, and let it sit for a few minutes. Dump that water out and add in freshly heated water of the appropriate temperature and steep your tea!

If you add hot water to a cold pan, it'll go from near boiling to mildly warm really fast.",5,Fishdude94

18vtiy6,kftf83c,Drinking on an empty stomach may cause some stomach discomfort in some people - this is mainly individualistic and up to your preference. The main tip is do not drink 1-2 hours before or after meals as the tannins in tea block iron absorption. This has led to some frequent tea drinkers to have iron deficiencies. Otherwise enjoy your cup whenever you feel like it!,8,Einstein780

18vtiy6,kfv8pap,"Not doubting the truth to this whatsoever, but 2 hours before and after every meal is a 4 hour window 3x a day. 

If I eat at 8, noon and 5, then I shouldn't drink tea from 6-10, 10-2PM, 3-7, just seems a little crazy. That being said, if the only issue really is iron absorption, I could just take a nightly pill",3,moobs_of_steel
18vtiy6,kftjv70,Thanks for this!,1,Little_bird_09
18vtiy6,kfvref1,"Agreed, the ""1-2 hours"" is a general guideline, on which I also rely. It just means that I try to avoid drinking tannin-rich tea during meals and, if possible, give time for the food to digest before brewing tea myself. There is numerous studies on this and, in general, a very interesting topic. For people who develop iron deficiency, however, an iron pill supplement may not be enough to restore the imbalance.

18vd6yy,kfrqy5g,"I bought the ""Classic Tea Selection"" sampler on Black Friday and was pretty underwhelmed. This was with the 3.5g packets fwiw. I found each tea to be light on flavor but it looks like you have a few that didn't come with my sampler. 

I did a side-by-side comparison with for DHPs from different vendors and theirs came last. Teasenz took the lead on that tasting, which was a surprise after several of their other offerings had disappointed me.

Their Lapsang Souchang had a nice complexity but very light flavor and barely noticeable smokiness. 

The Yunnan black wasn't bad, a decent benchmark. The bag wasn't sealed, which I suspect may have muted the flavor. Normally I take tea straight, but I found this to be quite nice with a bit of coconut sugar. For the price I'm not disappointed.

I'm not big on TGY but again, felt it was lacking.

I haven't tried the Fenghuang Dancong, Yingde black, Minnan narcissus, or the Enshi Jade Dew (free sample) yet. 

I had high hopes and really wanted to like this company because I'm a sucker for sustainable practices, which they seem to support. The packaging is nice (other than the one unsealed bag). Part of my order was not packed with the shipment but support was quick, understanding, easy, and made good on sending what had been forgotten. I'm hoping the teas I've not yet tried will change my view. It seems like a good company overall, I'm just disappointed in the product. This can be changed and considering their switch in sample package sizes, it seems they take criticism well and are willing to make improvements. I'm open to giving them another shot in the future, but for now I'll continue working my way through the suggested vendors list.",2,Idyotec
18vd6yy,kfs5kpv,Nice review! Can you help me understand what you mean by frozen berries as a flavor note? My sense of smell is poor so I'm not the most nuanced taster but I'm struggling to understand what is implied by frozen in this context.,1,regolith1111

18vd6yy,kfrs1my,"It’s funny how people’s taste buds work. I definitely had to do a double batch of two combined bags brewing the first samplers. That was my biggest issue with the 3.5 gram bags. 

These over 5 grammers were perfect. I thoroughly enjoyed these and found them to be higher quality than a big vendor like yunnan sourcing but lower quality than some high end specific vendors. 

Overall, I think they have a solid market with their website and the vast amount of info they put out on their tea. 

Thanks for the comment!",1,Rip--Van--Winkle
18vd6yy,kfs608s,"It’s hard to actually describe it better than saying frozen berries. But I often buy bags of frozen berry mix with raspberries, strawberries, blackberries, and blueberries and when they get super frozen or freezer burnt they have a very specific aroma and taste. It is very noticeable to me having a fresh fruit smoothie or a frozen fruit smoothie.",2,Rip--Van--Winkle
18vd6yy,kfs6i2l,I think I get that. Maybe a bit tinny? Thanks,1,regolith1111
18vd6yy,kfs6uw8,"Yeah definitely a little metallic on the nose. You don’t need to be an expert to have good tasting notes. Maybe three users on this sub are experts and I am certainly not. 

The way I describe flavor and aroma notes are everything you can perceive that isn’t tea. Every tea has the majority flavor of tea. So if someone asked me what does this really taste like, i’d be like tea. 

Picking out the nuance and subtlety around that dominating flavor is what makes reviewing teas (and other things fun).",2,Rip--Van--Winkle
18uwacf,kfn229n,"Yesterday we were out in Anhua County’s Dafu Township visiting a dark tea workshop. As we were brewing up the gazillonth cup of bricked dark tea, I asked the owner what kind of dark tea they grew up drinking. To my surprise, she said that no one here locally actually drank much dark tea at home until very recently, despite hundreds of years of dark tea production. Instead, they drink a very light green tea that breaks all the rules. 
  

  
After dinner, we got to meet this tea. It is made by taking raw tea leafs, flash boiling them, hand kneading them while still hot, and then either drying them under the sun or over a gentle fire of ""maple"" seedpods (see picture two). That’s it. As you might expect, drying it over a fire makes the final product kinda  smoky, but both methods make an incredibly light tea. This lightness is compensated by its unique brewing style, in a bowl with sesame, peanuts, or toasted rice. With each sip, one needs to blow down on the bowl and kick up the tea leaves and other ingredients up to the surface so some can be sucked down with the broth. When tea time is over, everyone’s bowls are empty. Chewing on the tender tea leaves certainly gives the kick that the broth lacks.
  

  
Unlike many other places we have visited and lived in, most tea growers and pickers in Anhua have been totally disconnected from the final product. The factories and their highly specialized workers make dark tea for consumption thousands of milers. This was true 100 years ago and it is largely true today. The tea pictured above, 农家茶 (farmer house tea), was what the growers picked for themselves in the weeks between the first flush and Guyu.",282,OneRiverTea

After picking they let it wither, aka sit for 2-16 hours, in a shady spot, steam in a bamboo steamer for a few minutes, then roll into balls for several minutes in a piece of clean muslin or cotton packing it tighter and tighter which helps expel liquid. Then cured in an oven at 150F for 15-25 minutes to stop fermentation and get rid of excess moisture. Very light green tea.",22,WyomingCountryBoy

Usually I understand the umami looking at all the flavours that various teas can have: umami is usually only present in green tea, especially the steamed ones like Japanese greens. A green tea that tastes flowery and hay-like isn't usually very umami, in my experience. It is the seaweedy, spinach-y ones that, to me, seem to have more umami.

2. Where it’s from: This is actually Japanese, Kutani ware is made in southern Ishikawa in cities such as Kanazawa. 

3. What types of tea it’s for: As you may know in Japan they mostly consume green tea, although this is a porcelain kyusu so you can brew any tea in it. Some materials such as tokoname clay may take up flavors more readily and can be “seasoned”, but porcelain will not do so. 

4. What it’s made of: Porcelain

5. Lid and bulge: I believe the bulge you’re referring to on the teapot is the handle? If not let me know and maybe I can give you a a better answer. This is a yokode kyusu which means side handle teapot (any Japanese teapot is a kyusu if you’re curious, it’s just a general word and doesn’t necessarily mean it has to have a side handle, although you’ll see a lot of people referring to any side handle teapot as a kyusu). The side handle is hollow to disperse heat so that you can hold it without burning your hand. The teacup likely has a lid just to keep your tea warm. 


This is a really nice teapot and cup! Hope this helps",3,KimiNoSuizouTabetai
18v3ch1,kfqv625,"Hello. Like the other reddit or mentioned, this this a Kutani ware Japanese teapot (kyusu). The side handle configuration is based on Chinese herbal/medicinal boiling pots.

Your pot has a nice crackling celadon glaze and might even be handle painted, but the overall shape/fitting is slightly rough so I think it's a workshop production. I don't know kutani very well so can't tell you which kiln.

In mint condition thus might fetch maybe $100 to 150 as a set?

Vintage Japanese tea vessels aren't usually worth much unless they are guinomi/chawan or tokoname pots made by famous artists.

You can probably make some green tea or hong tea out of this. This set does not seem gongfu appropriate.

18vpyje,kft4y7p,"Food service person here. You need it to be above 140°f or below 40°f at all times in order to prevent bacteria growth.

Only two hours between 40°f and 140°f is enough for most things to cool off or warm up enough to start growing bacteria that will likely make people sick. the longer it stays at that temperature range, the higher the chance of illness because there will be more and more bacteria.

This is especially true of something that has food (like tea leaves and/or sugar) and water in one and more so when it's sitting still. Meaning any bacteria or even bugs and yeast has the hydration and energy to support life and will thrive, breeding/spreading really fast.

I recommend that if you need to keep tea good for a long time use a coffee pot. You can get them used for practically nothing. It's designed specifically to keep hot liquids good for a long time at a safe temperature. It's perfect for this application.

Some teas can actually be brewed the same way as coffee too.

Another option if you will be awake and alert is to just keep a hot kettle on the stove (or use an electric one) and pour it into a teapot or right into your cup as you need it. A tea cozy can help a teapot stay hot longer as well. This is not so great if you will be falling asleep and it will have hours to cool down.

One more thing, an unattended stove that's on can be a huge fire hazard and if it's not covered there is a chance of contamination just from things settling on it from the air. It's best to keep an eye on a burner that's on.",10,lfxlPassionz

Gong fu brewing is a high leaf to water ratio. Sometimes I will be at 8 grams of tea for 120ml of water. Because of this you are doing super short steeps but drinking many steeps. Sometime you can even get to 8-10 steeps. This is just because you have so much leaf you do not need to steep it for long or it will be better and overpowered. Once I get to the last 8-10 steeps though I will be well into the minutes long steep range. 

Western style brewing is low leaf to water ratio. Maybe 3 grams per 600ml of water. Because you need to get flavor into that quantity of water you are going to be steeping much longer. 

Both ways are fine, but I have my preference for sure. Some teas are suited better to each. Western style teas or flavored teas are going to be western style brewing. I don’t know many people who gong fu brew with earl grey. Chinese, japanese, and taiwanese are suited to gong fu or grandpa style.

I have tried a lot of types of milk and at the end I prefer condensed milk. The hot, after-boiled tea (approx 80C?) poured into the condensed milk with quick stir and that fits my taste.

Since you are addicted to soda and sweet drinks I would suggest you better start cut down soda/sugar intake. These 2 combinate makes a fast acting and stimulation to  your brain for instant excitement in exery time you drink. On the other side tea is a slow acting and so it really takes  time to understand the flavor (smell, feeling in tongue, and aftertaste) .",2,kl122002

18up5cb,kfo72la,"Mandarin orange spice from celestial seasonings company, plus orange blossom honey. Both cheap but delicious. I have tried other orange teas and they all taste like plain water. Add a drop of orange blossom honey if you can. You really only need a drop or two, not a spoonful it boosts the orange goodness from great to heavenly, but doesn't add a ton of sweetness (unless you add a couple spoonfuls). For my black teas, I switch between loose leaf Tetley and Russian caravan. The Tetley I either drink plain or add fresh mint leaves to (I grow mine in pots on my front porch along with my other herbs. Coming home always smells so yummy). Russian caravan tea is *strong* stuff that I usually get from Amazon. It's generally not expensive, it's just so strong like espresso coffee that a lot of tea drinkers hate it. Which is better for me because there's more inventory for my to buy instead. Lol. And for mint tea, the stuff available to buy is pretty awful too. Get whatever tea you like (earl gray which is milder in taste, Tetley, whatever you like) and get the freshest mint leaves you can. If you open the package and font get a blast of minty smells, it's stale. That's why I grow and dry my own. Even six months after tightly closing it, I can open my jar of mint leaves in the house and they're still fresh. I found this out when I opened a jar, and my hubby smelled them in the other end of the house and thought I was cooking supper. I like using my own leaves because they're not only fresher, but you can adjust how much mint smell and taste you get in your tea...a little or a lot. Lol. Just lightly crush or squish the leaf then add to your cup along with your tea. Let it soak for a moment or two before drinking.


My mil loves chamomile tea but I find it boring and nearly tasteless. Lipton is garbage. It's cheap and tastes cheap. I grew up on it so I thought it was delicious until I started trying other stuff. I can get a box of 100 servings/bags of Lipton tea for the same cost as a box of loose leaf Tetley that has over 440 servings in it. And no stupid bags either! Lol. As far as other flavors go, I'll have to check my inventory. I have a huge collection of non-black teas, but I'm having trouble knowing what's there at the moment since it's almost dawn here and I generally go through them quickly. I'll look for more ideas later since I don't always buy the same flavors, things are always changing so I can't recall what's there from memory.


I drink so much tea in winter that I don't use a tea ball or electric kettle or stovetop kettle. I cheat and use a cheap coffeepot. I measured out how many teacups of water the carafe can hold, then I put the loose tea into the reusable filter, add water, and brew. This doesn't work with herbal teas, mostly black ones. The water gets super hot which destroys delicate herbal or flavored teas. So if I was making the orange spice, I would just use the machine to make plain hot water. I would add the tea and some cool water first toy cup, then use the coffeepot water to warm things up a bit. I prefer a coffeepot because it not only makes hot water quickly, it keeps the water warm for hours do I'm not constantly heating more water. I generally drink two or three standard teacups of hot liquid every hour in winter, so the coffeepot is the easiest method for me.",2,Good-Sorbet1062

I know I'm currently not in the mental headspace to take pleasure in brewing matcha, so instead of buying it and *not being able to make it* - I just have it made for me by someone who cares about tea just as much and enjoy *that* experience instead.

I would also replace matcha with hojicha and hot chocolate with atole, which is basically champurrado sans chocolate. The masa harina gives it the body and heavier mouth feel you're looking for. There are also tons of variations on atole; I particularly enjoy atole de nuez, which includes toasted pecans. I've never tried to make atole at home, but it shouldn't be too hard as long as you can source ingredients.

I’ve been on a no to very very low caffeine regimen for years at the direction of my neurologist (migraines). I love herbal teas but I find the lack of “body” made it an unsatisfying replacement for my previous morning coffee ritual. Here are my recs.

Decaf coffee from the Swiss Water Process claims to be 99.9% caffeine free.

Tazo has a decaf black tea chai that is 100% caffeine free. Add any milk or milk alternative for a perfect chai latte.

Turmeric aka “golden” latte powder mixes can be an acquired taste, but I personally love them.

The vanilla powder from Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf brand is excellent for giving any herbal tea a little bit of sweetness and body. The hazelnut flavor is nice in decaf black tea or Rooibos too.

I personally dislike chicory, but it is a popular coffee-alternative recommendation.

Korean markets have lots of caffeine free hot drink options like barley or sweet corn drinks that are great by themselves or with a splash of rice milk. 

Adding Yakult to iced herbal teas and juices tastes really nice. Must be iced though because heat will kill the probiotics.

2. Add the miso paste and stir until it has dissolved.
3. Add the lemon zest and juice, ginger, wasabi and vinegar. Simmer to blend the flavors, about 3 minutes.
4. Add the oyster mushrooms and tofu. Simmer until the mushrooms are tender, about 10 minutes. Add pepper to taste. The miso paste should be plenty salty enough, so the soup probably won’t need any salt.

That is true for Tencha only (Matcha). Other first harvest tea should be available almost immediately, like Shincha as you mentioned.

>This is probably delayed further for organic teas, as each new harvest might need to be newly certified before sale

There is an annual check, but they do issue certificate for the farm, not to the batch. As EU has an agreement with Japan, required certificate grants the right to sell a product as organic. Can't imagine a longer period of few weeks or a month to process the paperwork on a shipment, but definitely not 4-5 months. The only reason I can imagine is a miscalculated stock management.

As for the rest of Japanese tea, I do know that Japan does have stricter laws and regulations regarding pesticide usage than say China for example, but pesticides are still frequently used. 

Japan tangent aside, most established tea sites will flat out say if it's pesticide free since it's a great selling point. The only thing op really has to look out for is how many pesticides have been tested for. A tea can be ""pesticide free"" but only have been tested for 40 as opposed to 200 or 400.

In general, India is much poorer than mainland China, the tea it farms is generally of a lower grade (in the sense of wholesale prices; obviously it’s still delicious) and more geared towards export, and it has a lot of other large scale tea frauds: the one you see mentioned is that Darjeeling exports are always way too high compared to how much could realistically be grown in the municipality.

18u0g1w,kfjqalb,"Well, that very much depends on what your budget is. :) There are plenty of serious suppliers that you can trust to sell you what they say they are selling you. It also depends on what construction technique has been used to make the tea pot. You will be paying a lot more for a fully handmade pot than for one where they used machinery to make some parts. I’ve got one of the latter and am quite happy with it, as it looks lovely, brews and pours well, and affects the tea just the same.

 If you’ve got a glazed teapot or gaiwan already, you can use that for all types of tea. Unglazed clay pots do affect the tea, but they don’t work well for all types of tea.  Different clays have different effects on the tea,  so depending on what teas you prefer, yixing might not be the best option for you.

I’ve also got some unglazed yixing clay cups and they affect the flavour of the tea too (and they were a lot cheaper!). It’s been interesting to experiment with different teas and see which ones turn out best in gaiwan + unglazed cups vs yixing pot & cups  vs yixing pot + porcelain cups.

If you want to buy a yixing clay pot, of course you should go ahead and do that, but if you haven’t already, just spend some money on really nice teas and an inexpensive porcelain gaiwan first.

18tgvpt,kff9yh9,"I'm also looking for a teapot. I found a lot of recommendations on this sub for the Hario ChaCha Kyusu Maru, so I asked for it for Christmas. I actually don't like it at all :( The biggest issue for me is that the mesh of the brew basket is super coarse, so you get tons of sediment in your tea unless you're brewing proper whole leaf tea. I also found that my brew lacked subtlety compared to, for example, grandpa style.

Folks here also recommend ForLife teapots a lot, and I'm looking at their Dew teapot for my next purchase. It's a nice size and the brew basket is bigger and reaches all the way to the bottom. Plus, the mesh is finer. Fingers crossed!",3,MonnyBon
18tgvpt,kfduwy7,"That completely depends on what sort of teas you are making, and how you are making them. Do you want to make tea western style or gong fu style?

Or western blends like English breakfast and earl grey?",3,Outside_Resolve503
18tgvpt,kff1541,"Based on what you said about teas you drink, and your goals, I recommend the teabloom Kyoto. 

The glass makes it so it won’t absorb stuff and mess up all the different teas you drink, it’s very easy to clean, has a nice big infuser for teas that need room to expand, and a very fine mesh for fine-particle teas (herbal). 

It’s also super affordable, and I think it looks very nice.

For drinking everything, you'll want glazed ceramic or glass rather than unglazed clay. And for multiple cups from one steep, you'll want 300mL+. Probably more like 500mL if you are drinking from a mug. I am partial to dobin style teapots in that size range.

online: tealyra and adagio both sell loose and bagged tea. ahmad is popular in some areas, I’ve only tried their cardamom tea. harney and sons sells loose and bagged, I would stick to their flavoured teas (if you like cinnamon, I recommend the hot cinnamon spice). 

grocery store: bigelow( especially constant comment) is a generally well liked american tea company that’s sold in grocery stores. Tazo can also be founded pretty easily and a lot of people seem to like their chai concentrate, though I’m more partial to “oregon chai” brand, which is harder to find. Republic of tea used to be fairly popular. 

general local: check and see if there are any international markets near you, as they tend to stock more tea than grocery stores. check out farmer’s markets as some have people selling tea. I would also try a basic online search for “tea vendor near me,” as you may be able to find small shops with no online presence that way, depending on your locality.

You appear to be new to tea, so here are some resources to help get you started.  First, be sure to check out our sidebar, we have some useful stuff there.  There is a quick reference with the guidelines on what temperature water to use, and how long to steep your tea.

[The FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/wiki/faq) was put together to answer many of the questions you may have, including more detailed guides for brewing tea.

If you are looking for places to buy tea, we have [The User's Choice Vendor List](https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/wiki/vendors/page_01) which was voted on by the users here.

[The Non-Judgemental Guide to Tea](http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/01/tea-for-everyone.html) is probably one of the best guides we've seen, and is highly recommended reading.

If you're more interested in iced tea, [The Tea Lover's Way to Make the Best Cold Brew Iced Tea](http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/06/how-to-make-the-best-cold-brew-iced-tea.html) might be just what you're looking for.

118bipf,k78ocwr,"That's because a green tea latte is usually made with matcha, which is the one green tea variety that has more caffeine than the same amount of coffee, and for some people, it really kicks them like a mule. It also depends on how much matcha they use, but it sounds like a lot.

To get the health benefits of lowering your caffeine intake via green tea you would need to drink a loose-leaf green tea variety (which is mostly anything that isn't matcha). Matcha is crushed into a powder and highly concentrated, sort of like coffee grinds in a way! It's less likely that you'll find coffee-house style beverage that uses one of these teas in place of matcha, but they do exist.  It's possible that you will need to just drink a simple tea.

You might also want to stay away from very finely broken leaves at least at first, like Fukamushi. Gyokuro can also be strong, but it depends (and still not like matcha). Some common recommendations are a basic Sencha, Genmaicha, Jasmine Pearls, Dragonwell, Jade Tips or Gunpowder. All of these teas should be very different from one another. If you have to have flavor in your tea, it's not hard to find something like a Sencha with coconut or strawberry.

If you learn how to make a good tea out of one of those, you can make your own lattes or milk teas from it with practice. Oolong can also be a very good tea to make milk tea from, but it has such a wide range that it's harder to make a reliable variety recommendation (each individual tea is so different).",3,bigjmoney

What kind of health problems?",2,Tetsubin
118bipf,ka0pp8j,"I have a personal theory that coffee is killing my sister and another good friend of mine. Both were crazy, crazy coffee drinkers. My sister has ulcerative colitis and my friend is getting her colon removed this year. I’ve begged and begged both of them to stop with the coffee and come over to the tea side. Nope, they won’t do it. Roasting is essentially burning and that’s a carcinogen. Maybe it’s all in my mind—but I have felt the effects of coffee on me and my digestion and system. I think there’s something to it. I feel it after one day. I can’t imagine going hardcore day after day all day with it on your colon. Tea on the other hand—like pure unadulterated green tea—magical. It literally makes me feel healthier. And matcha is next level. Granted, I don’t drink green tea like that everyday. Mostly I’m drinking black tea with cream and sugar. That doesn’t feel very healthy honestly, but in comparison to coffee it’s a vast improvement.",1,Thinkheather
118bipf,jpd536h,"It's amazing how much coffee can affect someone's health. A lot of my issues I believe to be adrenal / thyroid related. The times I have brought it up to my GP he has refused to send me to a specialist. So ultimately I don't have a concrete answer. Coffee, heat, stress, sugar and carbs all exacerbate it. Amazing how destructive coffee can be.",3,throwawayadvice102

118bipf,jpequqt,"Actually yeah, I believe so. That's probably what I'll end up doing. I ate one bar of 85% dark chocolate today instead of my usual two. It's evening here and I am noticing a difference already. Wayyy more energy than usual.",2,throwawayadvice102
