199kth9,"Fellow Ode Gen 2 vs Comandante C40 for pourover, a hobbyist's comparison",3,0,self,"About a year ago we [compared a Mignon and a Niche for espresso](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/10q2taz/mignon_single_dose_vs_niche_zero_for_espresso_a/). As we clearly preferred the flat burrs for espresso we recently bought a Fellow Ode Gen 2 to compare to the Comandante C40, which we exclusively used for the last few years for pourovers.

Compared to espresso, we feel the differences between coffees are more subtle with pourovers and we feel the same for the difference between the two grinders. That said, we find the Ode2 to give sweeter, slightly more acidic cups and so it's often easier to taste all the aromas. We mostly preferred the Ode over a wide range of coffees and recipes. However, there are some recipes, that are tuned to the Comandante, like [Tetsu's Switch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC8K40kZ_6E), which is rather boring with the Ode. Also, the Ode2 might be a little more forgiving: I feel I had less clogging and no subtly bitter cup yet, while with the Comandante that still happens from time to time and was very common until it was seasoned. I did not yet notice effects from seasoning the Ode, but I was constantly changing coffee and methods.

Going from a cheap ceramic grinder to the Comandante was a huge improvement, but a coffee that is boring or unpleasant ground with the Comandante will still be the same ground with the Ode. Method or water make a larger difference.  I personally wouldn't get the Ode just for the taste, while I absolutely would replace a Niche with a Mignon for Espresso.

However, I was surprised by how big the difference in workflow feels. I rarely brew the same recipe twice in a row, and setting the Comandante and grinding takes a few moments, which I'd rather spend drinking the coffee or sleeping. The Ode is set instantly, grinds much faster and you can do something else in the meantime, like rinsing the filter, that's a big plus for me. On the other hand I have great memories drinking tasty AeroPress coffee in the outdoors or while traveling and that's something only a hand grinder can give you :-) Nowadays there would be cheater and more compact alternatives, on the other hand the Comandante is the de facto standard and many recipes are tuned to it, making it nice to have.

If you have both and want to adapt recipes, see [/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/yb2jea/translation\_of\_comandante\_c40\_clicks\_to\_ode\_v2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/yb2jea/translation_of_comandante_c40_clicks_to_ode_v2/).

TLDR; How the taste changes is what we expected, but the change is rather small. However, it turns out I much prefer the handling of an electric grinder and I also really enjoy the possibilities that a hand grinder gives me outside of home, so I kept both :-)",qivi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/199kth9/fellow_ode_gen_2_vs_comandante_c40_for_pourover_a/
198okqv,Inexplicably haunted by Sour Coffee,84,145,,"For the past year I have been attempting to fix a constant weird sourness in my cup.

I have tried different brewers (French Press, Moka Pot, Espresso machine [cheap]), each producing sour, over acidic coffee.

I have tried different beans and roasts. Whole bean and pre ground. Different grind levels. Dark and Medium roasts. Barely any change.

I thought my apartments water was tainted. Bought a filter, and still nothing.

I heard maybe my brewing temp was too low. I brew my french press with fully boiled water directly from the stove. Somehow still sour.

Have I gone insane? Do I have a strange genetic marker that makes coffee taste too sour? Could I have been cursed at some point in my life?

Now, I'm new to speciality coffee so my proficiency in naming notes is not top tier, but when I first opened the bag and got a wiff of the goodiness within, the words that came to mind were rancid, rotten, fecal.
Not overpowering to the point of seeming spoiled, but it's clearly there. The coffee tastes fine, good even (though it definitely tastes like Kalamata olives to me, but as I said I'm inexperienced).

I've read that coffee contains the compound indole, and I know I have a sensitivity for its brother, skatole (white pepper smells like horseshit to me). A concentration of less of 1% of indole is supposed to smell like white flowers (jasmine contains indole), higher concentrations smells like, well, shit. One of the tasting notes in this coffee is jasmine, but I don't know if that implies a higher concentration of indole than usual.

Or it's supposed to taste like that and I should describe it more appetizingly... Pungent? Funky? Fermented?

194v9ii,Coffee inconsistent from day to day with same technique,17,45,,"Lately I've been having a problem where my coffee tastes wildly different from day to day, and I cannot for the life of me figure out why. 

The equipment I use is:

Encore grinder (usually set at ~18)

Bonavita Connoisseur machine

Weighing my coffee, usually I make 6 ""cups"" on the machine and use ~57g of coffee to do it. 

Currently I'm using a medium roast blend from a local roaster, but I've had this issue with all sorts of coffees.

I grind several days of coffee at once, but it's stored in a vacuum sealed container so I don't think it should change much - it also doesn't linearly get worse, some days are better tasting and some days are not.

Even with keeping all these the same every day, I rarely get the same coffee twice. Some days (not very often) it's great, has a nice deep chocolatey flavor. Mostly it's bland, sometimes it's a bit sour.

I usually take apart the grinder and clean it between each time, so I don't think that's the issue. It could possibly be my machine needs descaled, but other than that I'm at a bit of a loss.

194469s,Adding Nuts to Coffee: A Short Guide to Save Others the Same Rabbithole I Fell Down,64,35,,"**Background:** I am no barista. I am just a coffee lover who heard about a new way to play with my coffee and had to find out more. New Mexico's Piñon coffee is what kicked off this investigation but as far as I can tell any nut will do.

**Ratio:** Use a 2:1 of grounds to nuts. Do not lower the amount of coffee and substitute nuts, though. I.e. if you do a 15:1 water to coffee ratio like I do you would add an additional .5 of nuts. The recipe I used is below:

16g dark roast coffee
8g pine nuts
240g water

**Methodology:** Adding nuts to coffee can get messy if done wrong. The best advice I found was to grind the nuts separatly by smashing them into grounds. I just used a cup and plate for this but if you have a motar and pestle, more power to you. The only prohibative here is **DO NOT USE YOUR BURR GRINDER FOR NUTS**. The fats will turn solid and you'll gum it up with the resulting nut butter.

To brew, simply mix your nuts and grounds together and brew using your preferred method. The method I found most commonly used was a course grind in a french press but my french press is not great so I opted for a pour over.

The resulting coffee will have a distinct buttery nutty note without the fakey aftertaste found in most nut flavored coffees. The pine nuts specifically brought a very pleasant pine-y (surprising,  I know) woodsy aeromatic.

If anyone here knows more about this than me, please feel free to fill in any gaps or recommend some changes. I'm still experimenting with this method so I'm open to refining how I'm doing it.

Here's hoping this helps someone in the future. Happy brewing!",MediocreHotSewgage,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/194469s/adding_nuts_to_coffee_a_short_guide_to_save/

194dulq,Oxo 8-Cup Usability Tip for Single Cup Brewing,4,7,,"Maybe this is already a widely known thing, but new to me, so apologies if so. 

I recently bought the Oxo 8-cup Coffee Maker and have been using the single cup mode mostly. The flip-over base (mug stand) is still so low for my mugs such that I was getting an unacceptably high amount of splatter during the brewing process. 

I was searching around the kitchen looking for something to elevate the mug (ramekin? upside down bowl?), when it occurred to me to try the carafe lid. Turns out it works great!! (at least for my mugs)

Just set the lid straight down on the mug stand and you'll have a stable elevator for you mug. The recessed area in the mug stand leaves room for the nub protruding from the base of the lid, providing an acceptably level and stable surface for the mug. 

[Carafe lid sitting on built in mug stand on the Oxo 8-cup Coffee Maker for splatter reduction.](https://preview.redd.it/b2f57ekasvbc1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d76916fabfb9d984c7311eb97663f7429bf671c1)

Maybe one could do better with a 3D-printed stand that fit more securely around the lip of the existing mug stand and offered more elevation and even storage within it (for what, I don't know - Gridz tablets?), but in terms of simple solutions, this works great. I found it to be quite stable for my purposes, but another approach to improve stability would be to plasti-weld a pillar to the base of the recess in the mug stand to capture the nub of the carafe lid, preventing it from moving. Anyway, if it's new to you, hope it helps. If this is old news, sorry, just enjoying life with a great coffee maker! :D",agoodyearforbrownies,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/194dulq/oxo_8cup_usability_tip_for_single_cup_brewing/

1947jl2,"La Piccola, Piccola",1,0,,"Well ladies and gentlemen, I thought I’d do my wife a big solid and offer her awesome espressos (or whatever else requires an espresso and copious amounts of foamed milk) with very little waste and above all a very easy process.

Did I ever make a mistake…

What annoys me most, is that I somehow find very limited information online. So, let’s start at the start.

It was a birthday present (26th of December, of course haha). And instead of forking over 300 EUR for a brand new one, without being fully certain she would appreciate it, I decided to go 2nd hand first. Clever right? Right! Except for the fact that I wasn’t clever myself. Bought it off a guy who had just upgraded himself to a new “automatic” version. It was in the same town as where my work needed me to be, so 2 birds with one stone. 

“It fits 38 mm ESE pads and I’ve just cleaned and reassembled it all. Would you like to test it?” I don’t drink coffee, so that doesn’t make sense. He’s cleaned it, and stated to have recently exchanged the oring and will throw in his remaining ese pads, cause they don’t fit his new one. Awesome. Let’s pay and get out of here. I get to place and transport it in the box from his replacement machine, nice! He advises me the company that offers the 38mm ese pads, based in Germany. Perfect I think, we’re in Germany for Christmas with the fam, so can have it delivered to them in advance. Smooth saling!

On the way to the work thing I arrive early. So I order the 38 mm ese pads online.

Because I have nobody to test it with or for, and my wife and I spent the next week very close. No opportunity for me to do a test drive without her noticing.

Fast forward to 26 December. It’s set up for her to have a first coffee. We try to close the brew group, and the bloody pads are too big. It rips open the pad. Goddamnit, failed birthday present.

So I start doing some research. There are at least 3 different types of brew groups, 35mm (aka smart), 38 and 44mm. Guess which one we have. 35 mm - doh!

This guy that sold it to me has been struggling all these years being clueless that he’s not using the right ese pad size. We had chatted over the 2nd hand market app and he explained some “pro tips” to get it working. All good and well, but this is a joke lol.

I’m now stuck with 150x 38mm pods which need to be remoulded to even fit in the machine. The good news is that the company he recommend does offer 35 mm pads. So , in 150 days I’ll be able to order the ones that actually fit lol.

Next adventure.. spare parts. This darned Piccola needs a new brew group oring. All the documentation is pointing to only one oring, no different size between 35, 38 and 44 mm. But how will that work lol.

I’m hoping someone with some experience will be able to advise on a reputable European and English speaking company that holds the spare parts for all the systems not just the 44mm ese pad systems. 

I know the easy solution is to get a brand new one that fits the regular 44mm ese pads. But that’s tooo easy, lol. 

I need to find the right oring size. To do that I need to find some calibrated calipers. Don’t know anybody that has access to that.",SD2KING,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1947jl2
19380cf,Espresso shot table life?,20,8,,"Hi, I noticed that on the restaurant that I frequent, when there's only 1 coffee ordered, they'll make 2 shots of espresso, use 1 for the order and keep the other shot sitting. I haven't confirmed but I suspect they'll use it for the next order.

Now a question that comes to my mind, is that okay? Probably it is, unless of course if it'll sit there at their counter for a long time. But I wonder, how long of a wait time before it's no longer okay?",koji_Cz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/19380cf/espresso_shot_table_life/

This is certainly not the gear I started with, and I still remember really enjoying my coffee and how magical it was to be brewing at home at all with less decent gear. Sometimes I like to revisit that stage as a reminder that good coffee doesn't need to be cost prohibitive and that one can make great coffee anywhere with a minimal travel setup.

So today, I dug out the old 1.7L Rival plastic kettle (<$15), an Aeropress ($40, the cheap fench press + paper filter over the plunger I used to use broke), and my Timemore C2 ($50). I used my ridiculously hard tap water. Same Onyx Southern Weather beans (not my favorite, but been getting good results). Didn't even measure anything.

Results? Fantastic. Immersion is SO forgiving. Flavor wasn't quite as clean or present as with my usual setup, but I was 90% there, and I am still thrilled with that result.

UPDATE: I cross-compared a V60, with the C2 grinder, of the same brew with my tap water vs. re-mineralized R.O. I am almost pissed I spent so much on coffee gear before upgrading my water. It made more of a difference than I realized.",WrongSperm2019,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/192sur5/anybody_who_has_invested_in_good_coffee_gear_do/

1923v2v,Third Wave Water vs Coffee Water,22,83,,"Going to dip my toe into mineralizing distilled water,  starting with TWW classic profile.

While on Amazon, I noticed a competitor  called Coffee Water, which gives you enough for 25 gallons, about twice TWW for a couple dollars more.

Has anyone tried this product? Amazon reviews were mostly positive, especially when comparing to TWW users.

The Coffee Water is a one size fits all product and doesn't offer the roast profiles TWW does. Do the various profiles make a significant difference in the cups?

I'm brewing mostly pourover and immersion if that makes a difference including milk drinks with AeroPress and the occasional Moka pot.

EDIT: Cupped filtered tap water vs Third Wave Water vs Coffee Water. The tap water had thicker body with some bitterness  the TWW cup was sweeter and layered but a hint of saltines, the Coffee Water cup close to TWW but without the hint of salt.

I'll try more cups since my coffee/water ratio may have been a touch sloppy. But both TWW and CW produced distinctly better cups than filtered tap water.

I'll also try S&W Roasting suggestion to use 1/3 to 1/2 packet of TWW. Now I know what savory means. I'll cut the existing batch with some more water.

The CW packets may be a little more difficult to divide accurately.

Thanks for all the experienced feedback. My coffee has already improved.

1. **LOWDOWN (Edinburgh, Scotland)** \- cool spot in a ""below the surface"" location (hence the name). espresso on its own was phenomenal. avoid busy hours as they have very limited seating!
2. **Zvaigzne CAFE (Riga, Latvia)** \- best coffee in riga, also a 30 second walk from the park so very easy to grab coffee and go for a little walk. they had amazing lunch options as well.
3. **Rosetta Roastery (Cape Town, South Africa)** \- usually finished my drink within 2 minutes of receiving it. the milk quality is really good and the staff are very friendly.
4. **KIELO Coffee (Tokyo, Japan)** \- small, humble spot with amazing espresso drinks and pourover. i kept coming back here even after trying other more well known places. i think it was how simple and quaint the whole vibe was.
5. **Ethica Coffee Roasters (Toronto, Canada)** \- located in a giant warehouse. memorable for the aesthetic of the place, going with a 'Vietnam' red and green look, even having custom green lids for the to-go cups.
6. **SEY Coffee (Brooklyn, NY)** \- an institution in Brooklyn at this point and great if you want to do some hipster-spotting. the vibe is definitely stronger than the coffee, but still worth checking out.
7. **The Coffee Movement (San Francisco, CA)** \- probably my favorite coffeeshop by taste. they constantly rotate in new roasters and have a changing 'seasonal' menu of specialty drinks, all pretty much done to perfection. highly recommend their signature 'orange' espresso tonic, which i believe is available in the summer or fall.
8. **WIM Kaffee (Berlin, Germany)** \- a favorite in Berlin because of the really good ambiance and humble staff! they had really good pastries as well. Japanese-owned.
9. **Bricks & Mortar (Berlin, Germany)** \- the coffee was good, but in combination with the food and really nice interior design, a very memorable stop.
10. **sweet spot kaffee – specialty coffee (Munich, Germany)** \- amazing espresso drinks and really friendly staff. the people working here really knew what they were doing and even teach pourover and espresso classes. the place is full of heart. a 'sweet spot' indeed.

18zp2zt,The closest you can get to espresso with a Moka pot,76,47,,"Hey y'all! Long time lurker and I have a bit of a long first post (with some maybe semi radical ideas?) but bear with me. I'd love to hear what you think.

The short version: I've been on a journey to get as close as humanly possible to an espresso from a moka pot since I just don't have the room in my kitchen to fit an espresso machine (or want to spend the $$$). And I mean that amazingly thick, velvety, fits-in-a-shot-glass espresso.

Has anyone here done actual measurable/repeatable experiments? I'd love to hear about it so that eventually, we can all reliably get maybe 90% of the way to an espresso at much lower cost.

Here's are the factors I've been toying with:

- Grind size (of course)
- Bean
- Amount of water
- Temperature of water
- Electric stove procedure (specifically, I use a two step process where I put the stove to max, and control the amount of heat going into the base by controlling how far off center it is from the element first starting almost fully on, then moving to about 30% of the base on the element so I can get a consistent flow rate)

I experimented with a WHOLEEEEE bunch of different stove techniques but this produced the best results for me for one very specific reason: The stove puts out a constant amount of heat instead of turning on and off. I noticed if the stove turned on or off party way through my brew, it got really inconsistent.

Another thing I've started doing different than what I've seen people do is I don't wait until it bubbles. Instead I marked the inside of my Moka pot so I get ~60ml each brew. The reason I do this is that is that you'll notice the first 2 thirds are thicker than the last third and I wanted that amazing thick espresso texture which the last third goes against.

I had to grind slightly smaller to get better extraction because of the shorter brew time but I'm closer than I've ever been.

It has the thickness, sometimes it seems more sour than it should be but I'm still learning about how it should taste.

I'm so damn close, I feel like we're  all just a stones throw away.

What do y'all think? Is this just a pipe dream?

Edit: I'm starting to wonder if the only way to do this is to take short videos or something and generally document the results with all of you.

Edit 2: This is way more attention than I thought this would get. Not much compared to the rest of reddit, but I expected like 1 comment.

18z6ahm,Water,35,18,image,"Question for the coffee water experts, I’m relatively new to specialty coffee and enjoying exploring various specialty coffees figuring out what I like and don’t, just ordered my third grinder (zp6, have eureka zero and j-max s) and use a few different brewing methods (aeropress, V60, espro bloom, and flair 58). I already filter my tap water with a 3M advanced carbon filter and think it tastes good by itself and carbonated. 

Dealing with quite a few brew variables and although the coffee water thing (third wave, lotus drops, etc.) looks really interesting I’m hesitant to delve into it, but also don’t want to leave something on the table that could detrimentally affect the excellent coffee I’ve been buying and taint my tasting journey.

recently I've been enjoying the process of making coffee in my Moka pot. I bought Bialetti Express 1, the smallest one. I decided to do a small taste test today, and I wanted to ask if my findings correlate with the coffee theory or if I am completely wrong.

The setup Bialetti Express 1 was 8g of pre-ground coffee (for consistency purposes, I will be testing grind size some other time), aeropress filter, the Bialetti induction adapter (even though I am on gas stove simply to smoothen out the temperature curve) and the main difference was that one cup was made with cold water in the boiler and the other one with hot water.

The one with cold water had strong acidic taste"" on the tongue"" immediately as it entered my mouth (not even sure how else to describe it) while the hot water one was a bit smoother and tasted less acidic overall, so it was a bit more pleasant. On top of that the total preparation time was much shorter.

Is that something that makes sense for those who are more experienced with the way a preparation process can affect the taste of the coffee or am I making this up?

I'm in Taiwan, where a popular brand (Louisa Coffee), is selling for a couple of months (only !) some beans called : Ethiopia Guji Edera Alcoholic Natural G1 ( 衣索比亞 古吉艾德處理廠•酒香日曬 G1).  
I absolutely adore this light roast that I brew in Aeropress with Fellow metal filter, and every day I am mind-blown by this fermented fruity taste, quite different from all African coffee that I tried (and loved) before.  
Can someone explain me what's going on with these beans ? Where does this taste come from ? What similar coffee shall I try ?

18spavz,Confused about consistency in measurement (grind size),11,9,,"Hi!

I have a baratza encore, and just got a j series 1zpresso hand grinder. I’m trying to dial in a similar grind, and thought “ok I can just look up details for both and match the grind size”. Turns out that’s not so easy. I’m surprised there isn’t a standard unit I can use to compare the two.  I’ve read a couple posts on there that say “every grinder is different even if it’s the same brand”. However, if we can measure microns, shouldn’t there be a baseline for every brand +- a few sizes?  
  
I’m trying to essentially answer the question of “what size is my grind” and then be able to apply that size to other methods of grinding. 
  
Anyways, i found some apps and product that do help with that (including the super expensive sieve and their helpful printable). It’s still really hard to compare the different grinds though. Am I going about this the wrong way?
  
Ps my current setting for encore is 12, which seems to be about 600ish microns. My j series was set to 18, and it seemed close.

18s2o09,Acidic coffee - is it the water?,10,56,,"So I'm new to the world of coffee geekness (1 month or so), and I'm struggling with acidity in my cups.
I've tried 3 speciality coffees from 3 different roasters, 2 light and 1 medium.
I've tried changing grindsize, brew ratio, water temp and steep time. 

Brewing in an aeropress.

My most used brew ratios has been 15:225 and 11:200.
Even with the most extreme settings (really fine grind (almos the finest Wilfa Svart Aroma can go), 11:200 ratio, off the boil, 10 minute steep) it comes out too sour to be truely enjoyable. The medium roast has come out decent a couple of times though. 

Just brewed the last of the medium roast beans, pretty fine grind (second ""E"" of aeropress), off the boil, 11:200, constant 2 minute stirring and a 1 minute steep after. Still too acidic.

I am confident I can tell the difference between sourness, bitterness and astringency.

I feel defeated. Is it possible that I am, despite my efforts, under extracting? Or is it that I straight up dislike the acidity of light roasted coffee?

I've tried to wrap my head around what makes good water, and I don't think my water is bad enough to produce what I experience.
Haven't measured anything, but I pulled the data from the water company.

pH 8, 
Total hardness 6.1 dH

Alkalinity 71.4,
 Calcium 35,
 Magnesium 5.4,

I read through a few articles, watched a few videos on what 'centrifusion' tech is about, which seems to just be pour over on crack. 

But still.... If the extraction is fairly even and the result is stable (tried and true), I wonder how far I could go with reusable pods, lighter or more interesting roasts and getting the right grind size.

18rk6tf,Flair Neo Flex and df64 Sanity Check,3,0,,"Reposting from /r/espresso for more opinions

Flair Neo Flex and DF64 Sanity Check

Long time pourover/aeropress brewer here looking to get a start in espresso. I’ve been eyeing the flair line of espresso machines for a while but haven’t been able to justify the investment as I don’t drink a lot of straight espresso. Now that it’s summer in Australia, I’ve been really enjoying espresso tonics and would love to make them from home. My plan right now is to roll with just the flair and some automatic grinder until winter comes around, when I’d buy a bellman steamer of some sort for hot milk drinks.

My question is mostly: am I crazy for eyeing a close to endgame grinder alongside a very entry level brewer? I can justify the df64 to an extent as I’d be using it multipurpose for filter as well, and it’s currently on a pretty hefty discount ($650 AUD shipped). I am concerned about how long the flair will last me - I plan to get the pressure gauge attachment but I’ve heard some misgivings about how strong the arm is. I’m most likely not brewing anything lighter than a medium-light, so that might help mitigate some issues with pressure (I think?).

One more quick question - in his recent video James Hoffman mentioned that the df64 wasn’t the greatest for filter. Is there anything I’d be able to do to mitigate this? Are there any decent multi-purpose burrs that would help on a budget? Should this be a dealbreaker for me if I plan to drink mostly filter despite the flair?

Now I started measuring, and I no longer know what to think.. Temperature inside the kettle is as advertised, but then the temperature at the spout exit drops 3-5 degrees. Temperature in the center of the coffee bed can be easily 10 degrees lower than the temperature in the kettle. The edges of the coffee bed can  be even colder for the non-plastic brewers (though it turns out that well pre-warmed ceramic or glass brewer retains temperature better than a ""minimal contact"" plastic Origami brewer).

Then we got the Aeropress - even after warming up, the first water you pour is 3-8 degrees colder than the final temperature when you fill it up and mix (if you don't mix there is a temperature gradient). Are all the recipes that call for filling an Aeropress halfway and waiting taking into account the temperature difference?

For my Flair, I measured the temp in the brew chamber and at the exit - the brew chamber is \~5 degrees lower than kettle, but the drop at the bottom of portafilter is more. Do I need to compensate for that if my roaster recommends to brew some beans at 91C.

[https://www.bodum.com/ca/en/11750-01us-bistro](https://www.bodum.com/ca/en/11750-01us-bistro)

This does a few things to turn this run of the mill (pun) Grinder into a much more capable machine. This machine suggests that it does espresso grind, but with this kit it will be capable of much finer results and grinds directly into your portafilter with a removable catch tray to easily keep your coffee space cleaner! There is also a hook on the right side for a portafilter funnel.

The new burr spacer replaces the original mount under the burrs to lift the burr up .9mm creating a finer grind that is consistently good for espresso. I find the final setting is too fine after this upgrade.

The new gear is carefully measured to replace the old plastic gear and is smaller in height. This is only needed if like me you end up shearing the nut off the stem when trying to remove it. Then once you have that sheered stem, you can drill a hole across for a cotter pin.

I have been running this for months (Since April) without issue and have been very happy with the results. The grinder can still jam and will need to be cleaned from time to time but I find its the same frequency as before on the finer settings of this machine.

Overall huge quality of life improvement. Has saved me the much higher cost of a higher end grinder.

I would say if you have been thinking of getting one of these grinders or have one already this is a huge upgrade.

18pabga,Trying to understand what I like and don't like... confused,7,13,,"Typically in the past I've liked the more dark roasted coffees that I hear people call ""burnt"" like Starbucks, espresso/french type roasts. I've not really enjoyed the more astringent, acidic ""bright citrus-y"" coffees that seem to be very popular at local coffee shops. Someone put it in a way I thought resonated with me ""Astringency and acidity in popular coffee is kind of like how hops became super popular in craft beer and it's not for everyone.""

Anywhoo, my wife gave me a pour-over advent calendar with 25 different coffees from around the world. After drinking (and liking perhaps 30% of them) over the past month, I had one of my dark roasts in my Aeropress today with Starbucks French Roast and could 100% taste the ""burnt"" in a way that I never have before. I use the Aeropress to make an Americano. It was really not appealing anymore, which is totally interesting to me.

So now I'm confused as to what key characteristics I actually like. I *think* it's more about the roast than the region of origin, but I know you folks here will have a billion times more experience and knowledge than me. It's like I need to find a less super dark roast but generally anything I've tried that's ""medium"" leans more towards the astringency/acidity that I don't like so much.

Any thoughts on what I should be looking for would be greatly appreciated.

I generally buy whole beans and grind them fresh in a conical burr grinder, then fill my Aeropress enough to make one 8'ish ounce mug and drink it black.

I’ve noticed that the couple of times I’ve gotten beans that are closer to a medium roast, I get very few to none of these. But when I get light roast beans I can get quite a few.

18oe0uh,Darker roast flows through paper filter better?,7,27,,"This is really messing with my head.

I make espresso on my days off, and I make cold brew (French press, room temp, ~24 hrs) for my work days. I pour the cold brew through a paper filter.

Espresso is ground with conical burr grinder, cold brew goes through a blade grinder and is very coarse (who cares, right? It’s getting filtered). 

Lighter roasts seem to work a bit better in my espresso machine, but then seem to clog up my paper filter more when I filter my cold brew. 

Darker roasts seem to flow better through the paper when I filter my cold brew, but then tend to choke out my espresso machine more.

This doesn’t even make sense to me. I would expect better performance in a portafilter basket to mean better performance through paper. I imagine “fines” are somehow impacting the situation. 

I have learned to compensate for whatever situation I am currently dealing with, so there’s no solution needed here.  I’m just really curious what the hell is going on.

18nl479,Enjoying French press much more than pourover - was i doing something wrong?,108,69,,"The other day I made myself a coffee (natural, eithiopian) using a 1-person french press, for whatever reason. I was struck by a cascade of delicious flavours -- all the funk, fruit, juicy notes that i love from african coffees, and which i sometimes struggle to recreate at home.

I usually use a clever dripper (maybe not a pour-over strictly speaking but some story really?), and when i swtiched back to that, i didn't get nearly as much flavour.  Same coffee, next day.  Much more bland.

So what's going on?  I've heard paper filters filter out a lot of the oils in coffee, so maybe that's the difference?  I've tried varying the grind a little, in both machines, but no significant difference - the french press tastes much better, either way.

should i investigate metal filters for the dripper maybe?

A lot of brewers say that stalling ruins the cup but since i use tetsu’s 5 pour method i believe that it disturbs the bed more times than a normal single pour or three pour method. So I wanted to know how stalling is bad for a cup and how much does it actually affect a cup.

18kenvy,[Gear] Looking for an espresso grinder for under 1000 USD,2,13,,"Hello ! ! 

I'm looking for a mid-range espresso grinder for my home setup and am open for recommendations that go a little over or under 1000 USD too.

My current setup includes a Profitec GO and a Timemore C3 hand grinder. Although the Timemore C3 has served me well, I'll be converting it for filter brew. I'm seeking grinders that can deliver more uniform grind than what my current hand grinder offers.

So far I'm currently considering Eureka's Atom 65 as a pretty default good option, in terms of price and features it offers.
Varia VS3 is also another contender as I do really like single dose grinds with the low retention to eliminate wastage.

Likewise, I plan to use the grinder for the foreseeable future. Any help would be greatly appreciated !

18ito1m,Effects of Liquid Temperature on Taste Perception,3,20,,"Just want to ask your experiences regarding how big a difference in our taste perception can be affected by the drinking temperature.

For reference, I brewed a single origin Guatemalan coffee V60 pourover style. Tasting the coffee right after brewing, it's balanced with mild acidity and pretty strong mouthfeel. I even detected a mild bitterness in the cup. The taste notes are as indicated on the packaging.

I left it to cool to go about my chores. When I returned to drinking that cup of coffee (I think it has cooled to almost room temp about 30C), it tasted more sour, the body has seemingly disappeared. It's like drinking a totally different cup of coffee.

I do understand that the temperature of the liquid affects the way our taste buds perceive the flavors, but never have I thought that the difference is so drastic. 

Is this just how it is? Or the type of coffee affects the change as well?

18h353o,"Why can you resteep tea leaves, but you can't rebrew coffee grounds?",17,39,,"I've been watching this fancy Chinese tea channel on YouTube lately, and he says with high quality teas you can resteep 10-20 times (he distinguishes this from low quality tea common out here, which gets pretty bland after 1-2 steeps, in part due to quality, in part due to smaller amounts of leaves in a bag).

But with coffee, seems like it's one and done, throw out the grounds. Why is that? What's different between coffee and tea that makes it so? One thing I can imagine is that the leaves are larger, whereas ground coffee is basically maximizing the surface area, such that everything gets extracted first go. This would imply that you could better rebrew coarser grinds. But other than that, I don't know -- I would imagine it would be harder to pull flavor out of a dried, roasted seeds than leaves, but it seems the opposite is true.

18f8vcr,Variable temperature gooseneck kettles are underrated. Huge impact to my brews,36,50,,"I’ve been brewing Aeropress for about 3 years now and my coffee has always been “alright” - not terrible, but not great, my cups have never made me think “wow, this is really good”. 

After about a year of sitting on the idea, I finally pulled the trigger and bought a Stagg EKG kettle. The impact to my brews has been night and day. I’m finally making great cups that are sweet and balanced and with a better mouthfeel. I think there are two reasons for this. One, I’m able to brew at lower temps (195F), which I think is also allowing me to grind finer. Two, I suspect I’m getting much better and even extraction with the consistent stream from the gooseneck. 

The messaging I’ve seen from discussions online make me believe variable temp gooseneck kettles are very underrated. I wish I would’ve made the purchase much earlier. If you’re on the fence like I was, pull the trigger and buy it. You won’t regret it. (P.S. this is not intended to be a Stagg advert.

18d2o32,Coffee labels: what's in a blend?,13,20,,"Curious as to perspectives on coffee labels, blends specifically. For labels that identify the region, does the name of the region give the impression that most of the blend is from that region?

For example, Kona coffee blends in Hawaii are only required to be 10% Kona. The label WILL state ""10% Kona blend"", but do NOT identify the origin of the 90%, which is typically cheap imported beans.

Is this typical? Are there Columbian or Panamanian (or anywhere else) that have blends with 90% beans from an origin not indicated on the label? If a geographic region is indicated on the label, would most coffee buyers assume that the coffee is *mostly* from the region indicated?

Are there any coffee industry standards that provide guidance (or best practices) on labeling blends with a geographic origin? Kona blends are a real head-scratcher to me, curious as to other's impressions and what happens in other coffee growing regions who sell blends",Frankenfriend,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/18d2o32/coffee_labels_whats_in_a_blend/
18czhab,Pre-rested coffee,12,52,,"Is there any roaster that offers roasted whole coffee beans that have already been rested for the recommended amount of time (definitely not the months and months that can be expected from supermarket brands).

Every roaster I've seen proudly offers coffee that is as freshly roasted as possible. This obviously sounds good, but each and every one of them go on to recommend that you don't go on to use them for 4-10 days depending on roastevel and brewing method (which is obviously great advice). 

Has any roaster baked this into their production, ensuring that I can get ready to grind specialty coffee in the amount of time it takes for the courier to get it to me.  I get that the ability to use ""FRESH"" in marketing materials is invaluable. Perhaps they just add a little drop down option that defaults to fresh, but gives people the ability to buy a roast from a week or so ago

There may be something about coffee resting or coffee production that I'm blissfully unaware of, and perhaps there's a reason this can't happen, but surely there's a market for this.

NB: I know it's not hard to plan ahead, and indeed I have always managed it to date, but I'm sure I will find myself without adequately rested coffee in the cupboard one day. Surely there's an opportunity for a roaster to profit from taking one more thought process out of coffee buying.",billthekid1990,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/18czhab/prerested_coffee/
18cqrzn,Why is coffee in East Asia so cheap and high quality?,48,79,,"Less a question about $10 lattes in Williamsburg and more about buying coffee beans directly.

In Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, etc., it’s very easy to find high quality coffee beans at a fraction of the price in the US. Often these are beans sourced from South American or African countries, so the price difference can’t be because they’re locally grown.

What explains this difference? Is it because of macroeconomic factors like real estate and labor costs? Or is there something specific to the US?

UPDATE: the conclusion I’m getting to is:

- The cost of green beans is similar (unless there are high tariffs), but roasting & inventory management is cheaper due to labor & real estate costs. This shows up as cheaper coffee beans from comparable specialty roasters. 
- East Asian countries have lower costs overall, e.g. food, rent, and other services are much cheaper than the US. So people have more money to splurge on high end coffee, which explains the prevalence of high end cafes. Most Americans can’t fathom spending 2-3x more on their coffee vs. their food (imagine spending $20-30 on an iced coffee)",misterbowfinger,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/18cqrzn/why_is_coffee_in_east_asia_so_cheap_and_high/

18914fi,[Photo] I made the famous church basement coffee,218,111,,"First of all, forgive me. Second of all, here's the recipe and opinion on this:
One morning i found myself with 15 g of Columbia La Violeta beans, adventurous spirit and an EGG. So the answer to what should be done was clear. I took
-15g of beans grinded like one would for V60
-250 ml of water(150 for initial boil, 100 added later)
-small chicken egg

I put 150 ml of water in a small pot and put grounds and egg(Without shell) in a cup and while water was coming to a boil whisked it questioning my life choices. 

When water started boiling i added ommele...i mean coffee grounds with egg into it and simmered for 5 minutes, then added cold 100 ml of water and let it sit for a while.

The beverage then was poured into a glass through sieve, to examine the looks of it.

I have to say it tasted way better than i expected, like what would you expect from 16 hour fridge cold brew, but warm and with notes of egg yolk and i was really sceptical about the whole thing before trying. I'll probably still stick to a filter though, but i may ocassionally do this.",MagikGuard,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18914fi

1894fdj,La Pavoni are bad espresso machines,5,40,,"People love to praise these things on internet but reality is:

\- Super bad coffee most of the time. You can grind all the way you want the results will be very irregular from a shot to another. I have a Kinu m47 classic which is supposed to be a good grinder. I tried everything I could. Nop, bad coffee all the time, one good shot out of 1000.

\- Not reliable machines. ""they last forever"" maybe if you mean ""the boiler wont explode"" but you have to do maintenance all the time because for whatever reason the machine starts to whistle, a leak there and there, an almost unreachable nut to tighten inside the boiler, a broken glass to replace... There is always something wrong somewhere.

\- Steaming experience is awful. The wand is really bad and very close to the body of the machine which makes it hard to use with a big milk jug, you cant move it as you want its up or down. All it does is warm the milk, you can have a very foamy result, you can make it do a nice spin but whatever you try you will never have a good mix of foam and milk and the good consistancy for latte art. I do everything as shown in the tutorial videos, I have a good result one time out of 1000 just like the coffee. I have better result with a milk foamer from amazon at 10€.

Overall not a good experience at all, would never recommand these machines to anyone. The idea of using these ""old school"" italian machine can be very attractive on paper but in practice its really not fun at all. Too expensive for what you get from it.

I know people will throw away my opinion saying I'm just bad etc. but ok idc, its just my experience after years of trying.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

PS: no joke, since I created this thread (right after changing a broken sight glass), I've got:

\- safety valve leaking for no reason

\- group head leaking for no reason (at the place where the machine releases the water when you lever down), drop by drop.

\- The pressure indicator goes above 1 which never happened before.

Lmao these machines are absolute jokes, and there is no ""skill issue"" involved. These are soooo inconsistant. You can think an issue is solved and the day after the machine becomes crazy for no reason even though you touched nothing. Bad noises, bad extraction with the exact same settings... Inconsistance is exactly what defines La Pavoni.

&#x200B;

PS2: I should have added that: I'm wasting a lot of good quality coffee by trying with this machine. Each time you want to drink a different brand or type of coffee you have to readjust extra precisely and make more tests to find to good spot. If you dont find it, the coffee will be awful. Not ""ok"" just awful. These machines arent good.

Edit 3: I bought an accessory from coffee sensor to make ""better"" milk, its an extended tip for the steam wand and... lmao. This is leaking on the top. And when I searched for a solution I found out that I needed another accessory for my accessory.

THIS is CRAZY. These machines need tooooons of accessories to work correctly and people pretend these are good coffee machines. I wouldnt need all of that if it was good in the first place. And even the accessories need accessories. Some dont realize the madness it is. Avoid La Pavoni at all cost people.",ExtremeEntrance1060,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1894fdj/la_pavoni_are_bad_espresso_machines/

I ordered it in 18th of November which in that time I have had multiple order from the UK arrive here and since they are even known in the US for their advent calendars I was very disappointed when it never arrived in time.",BalisticNick,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/188dgw7/did_anyone_else_not_receive_their_19_grams_advent/

Does astringency absolutely indicate a defect in the brewing process, or sometimes it's just the character of the beans (this is assuming it comes from a reputable roaster) and it's acceptable within a certain limit? With some beans sometimes I get a bit of astringent aftertaste no matter what I do (e.g. going coarser/lowering the temp only weakens the taste without eliminating the astringency). Of course my technique is not perfect and probably there are still possibilities that I haven't explored.

183p2aw,Sourness,6,16,,"Hi all, 

I think I generally have a pretty good palette, appreciate wine, teas, whiskeys etc. for complexity and aromas that \*aren't\* from direct flavouring or some sort of flavour impregnation - i.e specific casks being reused or smoked teas.

However, I really struggle with specialty coffee having grown up with farly neutral and bitter coffee and with no expectation it would taste acidic. I appreciate that the lighter roasted beans produce sour and acidic (and I am conflating the two things, as far as I am concerned they're the same and wouldn't mind being challenged or enlightened by those of you who disagree - possibly semantic) coffee, but I can rarely taste past the bombast of it to appreciate any aromatic notes that are retained by lighter roasts.

Is the local specialty coffee I am being exposed to rubbish? Is it entirely subjective and there is a community who love sour coffee - but I can still find interesting aromatic coffee that isn't? Is it the way coffee should be appreciated and I just need to understand that I can't be part of it?

Please help :D

181ufvt,DIY Cometeer,3,7,,"Hi,

There's no Cometeer coffee where I live and due to unexpected events(don't ask) I realized I won't have time to do my morning ritual Pourover for a while. I was thinking if I could batch make something like Cometeer with my favourite beans it's going to be much better than other alternatives.

How would I go about it? Cold brew maybe? Has to be less than or equal to 30-40 ml at most since I will probably be using ice cube trays to store them in the freezer. I tried thinking about it but I can't get my head round making something that concentrated. A bit more volume would work fine but getting it down to 30 ml is going to be tricky.

Regular users can also post deals they come across. Come check out some of the roasters and other coffee-related businesses that Redditors work for!

Additionally, this thread will serve as the megathread for Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals. Please do not post them elsewhere in the sub.

We encourage everyone to post deals here especially since many roasters are holding specials to drive business affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. However, note that there will be zero tolerance for shady behavior. If you're found to be acting dishonestly here, your posting will be removed and we will consider banning you on the spot. If you yourself are affiliated with a business, please be transparent about it.

There are a few rules for businesses posting promotional material:

- You need to be active in /r/Coffee in a non-self-promotional context to participate in this thread. If it seems you are only here to promote your business in this thread, your submissions will be removed. Build up some /r/Coffee karma first. The Official Noob-Tastic Question Fest weekly thread, posted every Friday, would be a good place to start, and check out what is on the Front Page and jump in on some discussions. Please maintain a high ratio of general /r/Coffee participation to posts in this thread.

- If you are posting in this thread representing a business, please make sure to request your industry flair from the mods before posting.

- Don't just drop a link, say something worthwhile! Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!

- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.

- No crowdfunding campaigns (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc). Do not promote a business or product that does not exist yet. Do not bait people to ask about your campaign. Do not use this thread to survey /r/Coffee members or gauge interest in a business idea you have.

- Please do not promote affiliate/referral programs here, and do not post referral links in this thread.

- This thread is not a place for private parties to sell gear. /r/coffeeswap is the place for private party gear transactions.

- Top-level comments in this thread must be listings of deals. Please do not comment asking for deals in your area or the like.

- More rules may be added as needed. If you're not sure whether or not whatever you're posting is acceptable, message the mods and ask!

They've just raised the price from £3 to £3.40 (about $4.23), having raised it from £2.80 in the past year.

They're also now pricing an Americano at £3.40 (while an espresso is £2.80).

I think of batch brew as the most accessible and easy option on a cafe menu, but this puts it up there with made-to-order drinks.

Shocked, I went to the next best cafe and found that they charge £3.60 for batch brew!

When I questioned it, the barista blamed the rising price of coffee and said batch brew is one of the least cost-effective options you can have on the menu.

How is this sustainable? Does it mean batch brew will be phased out or will it just make pour-over seem like a luxury by comparison?",wandsworth,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/17wqb7m/how_much_is_too_much_to_pay_for_batch_brew/

17v68fq,Feedback on an idea for a coffee brewing method?,5,37,self,"Hi all! I'm trying to make a gift for my partner who loves novel coffee-brewing methods, and I wanted feedback on the function and safety of my design.

My idea is to create an air-tight metal device with 2 chambers: the top one empty; the bottom for loading coffee and water into; the two layers separated by a perforated layer of metal. Once the coffee and water are loaded into the bottom chamber, the device is placed in the oven at 200 degrees, so that the water evaporates through to the top layer. Once the water is fully evaporated, the device is removed from the oven and flipped over, so that once the water vapor cools down the originally-empty chamber should now be filled with coffee-water. (Here's a link to the [original blueprint](https://ibb.co/H4WFrTK) I made, which is slightly different from what I've described above.)

My current idea for how to actually make this device is to buy a Moka pot and solder the lid to the base, so that the whole thing is airtight. I'm thinking Moka pot because I'm worried about pressure build-up and I know that Moka pots have pressure release valves. Please let me know if you think this would work or have any better ideas. Thanks!

Edit: to be fair everyone, I knew this was probably dangerous and that's why I was asking for suggestions/advice for how to make it safer if possible. Since it seems pretty impossible to do it safely on my own, I'm no longer going to do it. In response to the flavor: I know the coffee most likely wouldn't be good. Frankly, I don't really care how it tastes.

In this weekly thread, industry folk can post upcoming deals or other promotions their companies are holding, or promote new products to /r/Coffee subscribers! Regular users can also post deals they come across. Come check out some of the roasters and other coffee-related businesses that Redditors work for!

Note that this thread will be weekly at least for the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, since many roasters are running more specials than usual to drum up business.

We encourage everyone to post deals here especially since many roasters are holding specials to drive business affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. However, note that there will be zero tolerance for shady behavior. If you're found to be acting dishonestly here, your posting will be removed and we will consider banning you on the spot. If you yourself are affiliated with a business, please be transparent about it.

There are a few rules for businesses posting promotional material:

- You need to be active in /r/Coffee in a non-self-promotional context to participate in this thread. If it seems you are only here to promote your business in this thread, your submissions will be removed. Build up some /r/Coffee karma first. The Official Noob-Tastic Question Fest weekly thread, posted every Friday, would be a good place to start, and check out what is on the Front Page and jump in on some discussions. Please maintain a high ratio of general /r/Coffee participation to posts in this thread.

- If you are posting in this thread representing a business, please make sure to request your industry flair from the mods before posting.

- Don't just drop a link, say something worthwhile! Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!

- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.

- No crowdfunding campaigns (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc). Do not promote a business or product that does not exist yet. Do not bait people to ask about your campaign. Do not use this thread to survey /r/Coffee members or gauge interest in a business idea you have.

- Please do not promote affiliate/referral programs here, and do not post referral links in this thread.

- This thread is not a place for private parties to sell gear. /r/coffeeswap is the place for private party gear transactions.

- Top-level comments in this thread must be listings of deals. Please do not comment asking for deals in your area or the like.

- More rules may be added as needed. If you're not sure whether or not whatever you're posting is acceptable, message the mods and ask! And please, ask for permission first rather than forgiveness later.",menschmaschine5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/17tw7lv/mod_the_official_deal_thread/

17t43nq,"Is most ""excellent"" coffee expensive?",74,147,,"Bought a bag of beans from a roaster I frequent that were considerably more expensive than what I'd previously bought - I trust this roaster's sense of value and felt like treating myself this month. They have been perhaps some of the best beans I've tasted in my (relatively short) time drinking specialty. An aeropress I had today was transformative in my own ideas of the heights of coffee.

My question is this: in your experience, have the best beans always been the most expensive? Does anyone know of any facts, say for example, SCA score-to-price trends?

POSTMORTEM - WHAT IVE LEARNED

Almost all specialty grade coffee is more expensive than commodity - this is obvious.

If one prefers specialty grade coffee to commodity, then there is variance of price within this class. Price is simply a reflection of a commodity's supply-demand relationship.

""Quality"" by some vaguely (and probably misunderstood) metric positively affects demand. As does novelty, as does brand, as does many other things.

Types of processing, quantity of space to farm, conditions for farming, varietals, availability of shipping, and many other things affect supply.

In conclusion, there will be a high demand for most exceptionally good quality coffee. This may manifest itself as an incredibly high price, or a more reasonable one. In all likelihood, one can find exceptional coffee at a reasonable but slightly expensive price.

The reverse relationship is likely not true.",Old_Trade8477,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/17t43nq/is_most_excellent_coffee_expensive/
17sxwac,Paid gig as a “pop up coffee shop”,9,11,,"My friend asked if I’d be interested in taking a paid gig to make and serve coffee for 50 or so doctors and clinicians at a hospital. 

For context: I am a hobbyist at best. By no means professional and I’ve never served in a work setting. Though, I have my own setup and equipment to make pour over coffee, espresso, and espresso based drinks at home. My wife got my friends and family together once to run a mock coffee shop for my birthday (like in videos you’ve probably seen online.) My friend works at a hospital clinic of roughly 50 people. The admin there are considering hiring a “barista” to come in and serve coffee to the clinicians as a sort of appreciation gift. Previous years, for example, they hired massage therapists and offered them massages. 

I think it’d be more fun than anything. As long as the pay, which sounds like a rate i create, gets mildly close to what I’d make in a day in the office, I’d be willing to bite the bullet and just spend half a day making coffee.

My main concerns are:
- what might be a reasonable rate for at most, 50 or so people from 6am - 12pm (cost per cup OR a flat rate)
- what offerings would you serve? I’m thinking a very simple menu: pour over, espresso, latte. Medium and dark roast. 
- looking for any general or practical advice or things to consider, from people who either have owned or worked in a pop up type coffee shop.

I have become friends with a local roaster/distributor and I get to try all the interesting things he gets in. Recently he convinced me to try some single origin 100% robusta from the mountains near Hanoi and it's sooooo good. It's a little bit more bitter than the blends, but it has a rich chocolate flavor with some acidity, and man it's like rocket fuel. My normal brew measurements get me \*wired\*.

17pzc3w,Aeropress logic puzzle: coffee for a crowd,7,28,,"Hi everybody, I'm in a bit of a dilemma and need some advice/recipes.

The situation: I'm hosting a small conference (\~30 people), and I'm suddenly not able to get coffee delivery for one of the days (long story). During that day, there are three planned coffee breaks. I am panicking.

However, I would like to save the day with the equipment I have in my office and the work kitchenette. I have a regular-sized aeropress, 6 two-liter carafes, an electric kettle, and a scale. Can I reasonably pre-make enough \*coffee concentrate\* with my aeropress that I can just add some to each carafe, add hot water on top of it, and nobody will know that it wasn't brewed in a big machine? Can I prep this the night before so all I have to do is add hot water? Or should I give up this idea and do instant coffee and tell no one (very much the last resort)?

And if I can do this, is there a recipe and technique anybody would recommend?

Thank you so much for help and advice.",ughforgodssake,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/17pzc3w/aeropress_logic_puzzle_coffee_for_a_crowd/

Note that this thread will be weekly at least for the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, since many roasters are running more specials than usual to drum up business.

We encourage everyone to post deals here especially since many roasters are holding specials to drive business affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. However, note that there will be zero tolerance for shady behavior. If you're found to be acting dishonestly here, your posting will be removed and we will consider banning you on the spot.

- If you are posting in this thread representing a business, please make sure to request your industry flair from the mods before posting.

- Don't just drop a link, say something worthwhile! Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!

- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.

It’s my understanding that blending some for consistent flavor and shelf stability, with the coffee’s flavor remaining acceptable over a certain period post-roast and that this is possible because different beans safe at different rates. I’m a big fan of Japanese coffee and I’ve noticed that blending is more common with high end coffees in Japan, which makes me feel there’s probably something more there considering the Japanese coffee culture’s focus on quality and consistency. 

I’ve read most of what is out there for home roasters and haven’t seen the level of detail that would allow a novice to progress past single origins, which in my experience seem to stale faster than blended roasts.

At home we have a Melitta Caffeeo Barista, which grinds whole beans, and can make an expresso, a capucchino, a latte machiato, just milk froth or just hot water. With the app you can set the coffee-milk ratio in mililiters, but i usualy just drink the deafult latte: 120ml milk and 70ml coffee, set on the almost highest strenght. But it still doesn't feel strong enough, i want more coffee, stronger, with a bit of milk/cream and a teaspoon of sugar. 

I found a grinder and a french press on a local (slovenian (EU)) site for about 25euro. And asked my dad, a trained culinary technitian (basically a trained chef/waiter, in a secondary school program), what he thinks. And he said that the coffee from a french press is disgusting, and that its not worth the money, that i have an expensive machine at home that can make all the same coffee. 

What tools would you recomend for a beginner to make coffee on my own, ie. without a machine? And maybe a tip or two on how to convince my parents to at least try it with me (i have the cash to buy it, but they think its a waist of it).

17l2dk0,Stagg kettle doesn't work on inverter,2,2,,"I'm hoping someone here has experience resolving this issue, I've just started researching it and will continue to do so giving any updates. My kettle just arrived today, pro model if it matters, and I ran into this problem right off the bat. I can run it no problem off my Go Power GP-3000HD(3kW) inverter, but once it gets close to the set point it triggers an alarm on the inverter. It seems the inverter manual doesn't specify what the alarm means, just that one goes off for overload, low voltage, over-volt, or overheat; maybe the alarm is universal. What I can deduce is that none of those criteria are met, wattage peaked ~1100, fan isn't running so it's not hot, and voltage bottomed out at 11.5 while the alarm triggers at 10.5. To boot, I can run the microwave at 1200w no problem, switch back to the kettle and it fails immediately. I did a bit of searching and someone had a similar issue with a different kettle, someone replied saying that the device using a TRIAC is the source of the issue. Does the Stagg Pro use a TRIAC, if so would that cause this? Any ideas for a solution or of any other possible causes?

17ihunw,Morning Routine - Pre-Boiling?,34,86,,"I really love making my pour over every morning. However, I have a very long commute and like getting on the road as soon as possible, so every minute matters.

This got me thinking - I have an electric kettle I really like, but I can't set it up to turn on before I wake up. It takes a few minutes to heat the water up; ideally I could fill it up the night before and have it turn on automatically so the water is ready when I hit the kitchen. Unfortunately, the kettle only starts when I press a button, so I can't use a smart switch that turns on automatically in the morning.

Does anyone have any advice for this? I was thinking either a programmable kettle or one that could be combined with a smart switch, but all ideas appreciated.",jxh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/17ihunw/morning_routine_preboiling/
17i5ev0,Timemore C2 vs 1zpresso X-Pro,19,40,,"Hey guys,   
I'm relatively new to coffee (been about 4 months) and currently brew using an aeropress, pour over and Mizudashi cold brew. I'm looking to buy a manual grinder and I can get the Timemore C2 for about $40 and 1zpresso X-Pro for about $170 where I live. I understand that X-Pro is definitely going to be better than the C2 but is it worth the price difference given my brewing methods? I don't mind paying extra as long as the difference in grind quality is significant. 

Also wanted to get an idea about how electric grinders might fair in comparison to the X-Pro (given that I only care about grind quality). I'm getting really good deals on the Encore ESP, Sette, Virtuoso+ and Vario. ",nitingarg1000,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/17i5ev0/timemore_c2_vs_1zpresso_xpro/

17f6gqe,I’m a dumbass who needs help understanding coffee,398,244,,"I haven’t interacted much with reddit, so bear with me. 

For context, I am a former member or the Mormon church. It’s a weird ‘rule’/custom in the Mormon church to refrain from drinking coffee and other caffeinated beverages (or at least it was in Utah where I was raised). I was very heavily sheltered by my Mormon family and basically meant that I grew up knowing nothing about coffee at all. It’s embarrassing to admit, but that’s just how it was.

Fast forward, I’ve moved out, and there is a really lovely cafe that I’ve heard serves amazing drinks. Issue is I don’t know jack about what these different drinks are. I’m vaguely aware of the various kinds, but I couldn’t tell someone what one was beyond jut being a coffee drink for the life of me. So, could anyone explain the major/general differences between an Americano, Latte, Cappuccino, Mocha and Frappe? How do they taste different?

I’m sure it’s a stupid thing to not know, but I figured it’s better late than never to learn. Please and thank you :)

Update:

Holy shit. I don’t know how much or what kind of engagement I thought I would get, but you guys have so much more than I could have guessed. 

Thank you all so much for all of your comments. I’ve replied to a few, but all of the explanations I read were extremely helpful in giving me an idea of what I was working with. Along with that, your words of encouragement and kindness are so appreciated! What many of you said about not feeling stupid for not knowing something is something that I will take to heart. Same to those who pointed out the bright side to me, that I have a whole new world of drinks to try out now. I’m lucky that I stumbled into such a nice community of you people. 

Anyway, that was probably way too long, but I wanted to say it. Moving on, I got my first drink earlier today. 
I read through as many comments and replies as I could and I got a lot of people recommending mochas and lattes. I admit to being quite a sweetooth, so I figured these would be up my alley. I ordered a small, hot latte with a pump of vanilla. Here were my initial thoughts:

The first sip had a very sharp punch of bitterness that made me worried at first because I had a hard time tasting anything else. But as I got used to it it got way better. I see what you meant by the milk tasting silky, it’s very smooth. It left a soft but distinct bitterness taste in my mouth that tasted really good. It wasn’t as frothy as I thought it would be. Then again,  I did get a small so I guess it makes since that would allow much room for froth. 

Overall, it was SO GOOD!! I look forward to making this a fun part of my routine. Experimenting and trying a new drink every now and then sounds like a fun way to change things up.

This ended up way longer than I thought it would be lol, my bad. But anyway, thanks for helping out with my mini-character arc and I hope you all have a lovely rest of your day or night <3

Regular users can also post deals they come across. Come check out some of the roasters and other coffee-related businesses that Redditors work for!

Note that this thread will be weekly at least for the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, since many roasters are running more specials than usual to drum up business.

We encourage everyone to post deals here especially since many roasters are holding specials to drive business affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. However, note that there will be zero tolerance for shady behavior. If you're found to be acting dishonestly here, your posting will be removed and we will consider banning you on the spot. If you yourself are affiliated with a business, please be transparent about it.

There are a few rules for businesses posting promotional material:

- You need to be active in /r/Coffee in a non-self-promotional context to participate in this thread. If it seems you are only here to promote your business in this thread, your submissions will be removed. Build up some /r/Coffee karma first. The Official Noob-Tastic Question Fest weekly thread, posted every Friday, would be a good place to start, and check out what is on the Front Page and jump in on some discussions. Please maintain a high ratio of general /r/Coffee participation to posts in this thread.

- If you are posting in this thread representing a business, please make sure to request your industry flair from the mods before posting.

- Don't just drop a link, say something worthwhile! Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!

- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.

- No crowdfunding campaigns (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc). Do not promote a business or product that does not exist yet. Do not bait people to ask about your campaign. Do not use this thread to survey /r/Coffee members or gauge interest in a business idea you have.

- Please do not promote affiliate/referral programs here, and do not post referral links in this thread.

- This thread is not a place for private parties to sell gear. /r/coffeeswap is the place for private party gear transactions.

17cgo6h,Blue Bottle tells me its coffee stays fresh for a year—any truth to this?,84,51,self,"I forgot to get more coffee from the local roaster I like, and ended up last night at the supermarket staring down the bags of coffee. Most of the better brands available (Stumptown, Intelligentsia, etc.) showed roast dates from at least a few months back, and were expired or near expiration.

The Blue Bottle bags, by contrast, had no roast dates whatsoever, just expiration dates (which in this case was 6/29/2024). I foolishly bought one because I was in a hurry. Googled how to find out the roast date, and came up with no information. I emailed Blue Bottle this morning and they told me this: 

> The bags used for the coffee we sell in Target and supermarkets — our Home Blend line — have been re-designed to keep the coffee inside fresher for more prolonged: for as long as they remain unopened, our new bags keep your coffee fresh for up to 12 months. The roast date will be 12 months before the ""best by"" date.

My question is, is there any truth to this? The Blue Bottle bags are not vacuum sealed, but perhaps they may be ""nitrogen flushed"" (I haven't asked). But even if that were the case, could it really keep them fresh for a year? Or is this just Blue Bottle finally deciding that it's going to drastically lower its standards in order to sell more product?

17c8h2f,Breville/Sage Precision Brewer REMOVED from SCA Certified Home Brewer List,22,51,,"Hi all, 

Coffee enthusiast here. 

I was looking for a good automatic drip maker I could set to come on automatically in the morning. I  know, it's a compromise between taste and convenience because I've been grinding the beans the night before. Nonetheless, after watching hours and hours of reviews I settled on the Breville/Sage Precision Brewer for it's ability to brew a GOLD-certified cup – meeting strict specifications from the Specialty Coffee Association. 

Despite good reviewers, both the original unit I purchased AND the replacement unit I received only a month later were defective. On GOLD mode, brewing the SCA-certified cup of coffee, they skipped the all-important Bloom phase. Technical support at Breville couldn't figure out why and replaced my first unit; I'm sending back my second and getting a refund. 

When I went back this morning to check out what other brewers are SCA-certified I noticed that the Breville Precision Brewer has been REMOVED from the list of certified brewers. I reached out to the SCA to find out why but I suspect it's performance issues like I've encountered.

Anyone else have this brewer and experience these problems? Or heard of a brewer being REMOVED from the certification list before?

# Mahlkönig and Marzocco launch the Sync System

[Link](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyMDt-7sIui/)

As of writing, I haven't had a chance to test this so am summarising what's available online and what I've read on Twitter/X.

Mahlkonig and Marzocco have announced an integration between their existing in-built analytics systems that allows specific grinders (E80W) to communicate with Marzocco's Linea, GB5 or KB90. However, I believe this won't work with the Linear Micro since that doesn't currently have the app connectivity required. That said, the Sync System is likely going to have little or no use to the home enthusiast.

The heart of the integration is between the shot timer and the grind consistency. That is to say that a usually short shot time would then cause the grinder to automatically grind finer - thus 'dialing in' the grinder to the machine.

In theory, this would mean that baristas don't need to dial in at the beginning of their shift. In practice, I think the people who dial in will continue to do so and the people who don't - only those people may use this feature.

My question then is, who is out there not dialing in, in the morning but also buying the latest commercial coffee equipment? Regardless, a cool little piece of tech.

# Carlos Pednas, CEO of Meticulous, releases an open letter explaining why he's going to court against patent trolls.

[Link](https://foamy-snowman-457.notion.site/Open-Letter-in-defense-of-innovation-72c66670a226469c877aa56cc6055f32)

Meticulous is the company famous for making automatic lever espresso machines. We love their innovation, creativity, and originality when it comes to re-inventing some longstanding technology.

However, not everybody is as big a fan as I am...

Carlos' letter is, in fact, quite a moving account of his motivation, his personal drive, and his commitment to the vision at Meticulous.

At the same time, it's a fairly sobering story of the ways the patent system fails innovators and channels CEOs toward litigation and conflict.

17a8ivl,Natural processed coffee gone bad?,6,21,,"Curious if this pungent (almost rotten) smell (and taste but to milder extent) is typical of a good natural processed coffee is normal.  Perhaps I haven’t acquired the taste yet?   

Regarding preparation -  I do pour over (15g coffee 250g water).  Quite fine grind (1zpresso Xpro.. setting roughly 1-2.5… meaning one full rotation then number 2.5 on dial),  about 212f water.  Only been experimenting about 6 months (daily), so perhaps a noob but aspiring.

My first 2 naturals got me hooked.  They were 
  - CounterCulture Buchiro Natural Sundried from South Kivu in Congo; strong character but none of this almost rotten smell/taste (but I also grinder little more coarse back then, like maybe 2-2); loved it.  
  - Andytown Roasters Niguse Nara Bombe, Ethiopia Natural (doesn’t say natural sundried).  Very diffeeent from previous,  but delicious blueberries! Light and clean.  No pungent smell or taste at all.

Next and recently comes the crazy pungent
  - CounterCulture Kabtamu family, Yirgacheffe Ethiopia, natural sundried.  First time I smelled and tasted this.  Makes me wonder if the fermentation went bad?  But I like and trust counter culture.  Still
Available on their website. 
  - Andytown Satipo Finca Tasta, Peru natural (again doesn’t say natural sundried like CounterCulture does).  Not as pungent,  but still there.   I just got this today and this made me reach out because 2 nasties in 1 week.

Is this normal?  Maybe it’s an acquired taste,  like my love of very hoppy IPA and strong peaty scotch.

178sb5j,trying to find a good value sub £300 second hand espresso machine.,11,36,self,"Hiya coffee heads.

Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask, but I've been looking to get an espresso machine lately and figured I would get better value on the second hand market. Any advice you have is greatly appreciated.

 My research so far has been  [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HIGdYy5of4) [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0kQ5WqjcU8) hoffman videos (not sure what the opinion is of him here, but i found his aeropress and moka pot videos very helpful) plus this [budget espresso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1LUkfpTtu0) video he did. The more expensive ones are still out of my price range on the second hand market, and I'm not really interested in modding my machine, maybe swapping a component like a filter or a tube but I've had to desolder a mechanical keyboard before and found it moderately stressful. Not the end of the world but I'd much prefer something that works ""out of the box"". Hence most of my thinking is based on the first video - I can deal with minimal user intervention like replacing a tube or buying a different portafilter, and his ""it'll make you decent espresso without really trying"" recommendation is the sage bambino plus.


I realise that the grinder is important too. I currently have a wilfa svart that i really like for filter, aeropress and moka pot, but could allocate more money towards upgrading that too (they go for on average £100 on ebay so could go to another £250 ish second hand) if that would get the best out of the coffee and machine that i buy, but it would have to be a grinder that can do everything (and i would probably look at doing that in a couple of months from now, probably after the new year).

I generally prefer medium roast coffee, and totally understand that i will not get the best out of light roasts with a set up in this price range. anything that does medium - dark roasts is good for me.

With all of that in mind, i think that the sage bambino plus is probably what i should go for - they're available in the UK for £180 - £220 on ebay and i think that would be a good match for the grinder that i have? Plus it has  a milk steamer attached too (obviously a lot of machines have this, but the ""auto"" setting on this seems to be good for someone like me who has no milk-steaming skills). 

Please tell me if I'm making mistake, or if i could spend a bit more and noticeably upgrade. Thanks!


EDIT: Thank you everyone for your help. I think I'm going to upgrade my wilfa svart to a specialita and then see if there's any black friday deals for the new (post 2019 so that it has the three-way valve) gaggia, otherwise i'll get a used bambino plus (or used post 2019 gaggia but i imagine those will be harder to find). You manual espresso people very nearly convinced me with the flair pro 2, but i think that given I'm a novice I shouldn't jump into that straight away, maybe a few years down the line!",thegreeniceman,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/178sb5j/trying_to_find_a_good_value_sub_300_second_hand/

177zs5a,As a cafe is it just a waste to not roast your own beans?,55,59,self,"I'm confused - is not roasting your own beans as a cafe and buying specialty just a horrible idea?

Here's a site that sells green coffee: https://roastrebels.com/en/green-coffee?p=1

For reasonably good lots this seems to be at around 12 euro per kilo for 5kg. I would assume in bulk that price drops but let's just say you just aren't paying VAT (you wouldn't be as a business), and it's 10 euro per kilo. A kilo of square mile's redbrick (their affordable house blend) for individuals is about 4 times that, let's say 2x to round down and account for shrinkage and costs in roasting.

If you're saving 10 euro per kilo, and a roaster costs 5k (which looks about right for a small processional roaster). You'd only need to roast 500kg of coffee to make your money back on the roaster (keeping in mind these numbers are deliberately fudged against my point)

I doubt that the people that care about your coffee will outweigh that saving. If you use 50 kilos of coffee a week you'll make your money back in about 2 years? 


Possible flaws that I envisage with this:

• they get more of a discount on roasted specialty coffee than I anticipate
• my maths is somehow way off
• they'd lose a lot of customers by switching to a new bean
• there's other costs I've not accounted for that tip the scales

It was so darn easy! I followed James Hoffmann's method, and it took me under three minutes to brew a 300 mL cup of coffee. I'm probably gonna have to force myself to use the V60 from now on, so I don't forget how to use it.

## Ally Coffee Launches ‘Rooted in Coffee’ Podcast

**Ally Coffee is a global supplier of green coffee and has recently launched its new podcast series. We love to see more coffee media and I'll likely subscribe on Spotify to hear me.**

Short Summary of the latest episode using ChatGPT:

*In this YouTube video, Diego Campos, the 2021 World Barista Champion and Brand Ambassador at Cafe Amor Perfecto, discusses various aspects of the coffee industry with hosts Nick Castellano and Officer Ricardo Pereira of Ally Coffee. Diego reflects on his journey as both a competitive barista and coffee producer in Colombia. He highlights the challenges the coffee industry faces, such as egoism, the competition culture among baristas, and the need to portray coffee producers more accurately in the market. Diego emphasizes the importance of collaboration, sustainable practices, and recognizing the true value of coffee producers. He also touches on the role of language in the industry and suggests that competitions could consider competitors using their native languages. The conversation explores the potential for positive change and greater inclusivity within the coffee industry.*

# Kaffelofic Partners With Showroom Coffee to Distribute Home Roasters

As of writing, these aren't sold out in NA but I will expect them to go that way eventually. I have never personally used any kind of home roaster and I don't think many enthusiasts ever will.

As many readers will know, freshly roasted beans require a resting period of at least ten days before they are ready to be ground (due to elevated CO2 levels) and this means that home roasting is still very limited. It also means that any IG video you've seen where someone roasts and then immediately grinds beans is done simply 'for the gram'.

For this reason, I find it hard to see how home roasting machines will take off in the market but perhaps I will be proved wrong.

174t2y8,Homemade Coffee Liqueur - filter or not,14,17,,"Left: unfiltered 
Right: filtered 

I recently purchased a 1L oak barrel and have been experimenting. I recently made a coffee liqueur and with some of the barrel's particles coming out with the juice I decided to filter some over a V60 to help future me not choke on bits of wood. 

I noticed an evident change of mouthfeel, finish, flavor and clarity. Was curious for those who have made their own, do you typically filter your final product? Many big name brands like Mr. Black typically have sediment in their bottles so I assume they're not filtered (or at least not heavily). Thoughts?

1743t2y,Finding Cafes and drinks to try if I don't like Arabica?,21,51,,"I have never been interested in coffee, until I went to Vietnam (I'm from NYC). And I got hooked on Robusta coffee. 

I'm not a big fan of Arabica. I prefer the bitterness, body, and lower acidity (and the caffeine content may add a little subconscious bias) of Robusta. 

I have Vietnamese Robusta at home, and I want to get more into specialty coffee, but it seems like most places only serve 100% Arabica, or some kind of blend. Most of the time they don't mention it, because they just assume you'll know it's Arabica.

Even the Vietnamese restaurants and coffee shops near me use a 'Vietnamese Style' Arabica blend. 

How do I find cafes and drinks to try if I only like Robusta/Robusta-dominant blends? I've made some drinks at home, but I'd like to be able to go to a cafe/have an experienced person make my drink.

Any advice?",vomit-gold,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1743t2y/finding_cafes_and_drinks_to_try_if_i_dont_like/
17424rj,DF64V burr upgrade to SSP HU,7,14,,"After researching a ton and not finding much on the difference between stock DF64V burrs and SSP HU burrs I ended up pulling the trigger on the upgrade anyways.  Bear in mind this is after my first filter brewed with them, but the difference was so drastic I figured it was worth making a post! Keep in mind this was my brew using Onyx's Geometry and similar drawdown time with both burrs

**Clarity:** One of the most immediate things I noticed was immensely improved clarity.  I could pick out the flavors easier and they didn't feel like they were 'fighting' to be distinguishable in the cup.  

**Body:** As expected with HU burrs, I got a lot more body in the cup.  I personally like a higher body in both filter and espresso so this was a very welcome addition.  The cup feels way more substantial in the mouth and overall makes for a better drinking experience. 

**Acidity:** One thing that surprised me was an insanely lower acidity when compared to the stock burrs.  It was almost not even there with how low it was! I much prefer lower acidity cups even with light roasts so this made for an absolutely delicious cup for me.

**Misc:** The grinder was not only quieter while grinding, but it also took a bit longer. I suspect this is due to the less aggressive angling of the SSP burrs compared to the stock burrs, but this is just speculation.  It was maybe 10-15 seconds for the same amount of coffee at the same grind size, but to be honest it didn't make a difference in my workflow.  I think it's also worth it for the noise reduction.

**Overall:** Overall I'm super happy with this upgrade! It's exactly the way I like my coffee and I'm glad I didn't go with SSP Cast or MP, as the HU have enough clarity for me. If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment and I'll respond as best I can.  I'll be using these for the foreseeable future so if anything changes I'll also update this post!",Quarks01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/17424rj/df64v_burr_upgrade_to_ssp_hu/

Note that this thread will be weekly at least for the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, since many roasters are running more specials than usual to drum up business.

We encourage everyone to post deals here especially since many roasters are holding specials to drive business affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.

- You need to be active in /r/Coffee in a non-self-promotional context to participate in this thread. If it seems you are only here to promote your business in this thread, your submissions will be removed. Build up some /r/Coffee karma first. The Official Noob-Tastic Question Fest weekly thread, posted every Friday, would be a good place to start, and check out what is on the Front Page and jump in on some discussions. Please maintain a high ratio of general /r/Coffee participation to posts in this thread.

- If you are posting in this thread representing a business, please make sure to request your industry flair from the mods before posting.

- Don't just drop a link, say something worthwhile! Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!

- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.

- No crowdfunding campaigns (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc). Do not promote a business or product that does not exist yet. Do not bait people to ask about your campaign. Do not use this thread to survey /r/Coffee members or gauge interest in a business idea you have.

- Please do not promote affiliate/referral programs here, and do not post referral links in this thread.

- This thread is not a place for private parties to sell gear. /r/coffeeswap is the place for private party gear transactions.

- Top-level comments in this thread must be listings of deals. Please do not comment asking for deals in your area or the like.

172ytc0,Why do coffee liqueurs recommend cold brew?,27,35,,"Hey all, most recipes for coffee liqueur I see seem to suggest cold brew. 

But is this the best idea, based on what we know about cold brew? I thought the conventional wisdom is that cold brew, compared to a hot brew: is sweeter, less bitter, less acidic but can sometimes lose some of the complex flavour notes from lighter roasts.

Assuming these things are *roughly* true, then why would you use cold brew? You're already getting sweetness from syrup so don't need cold brew's sweetness. And that syrup will take the edge off any sour or bitter flavours. In fact, assuming the syrup tames those flavours, they might even *add* to the drink. After all, we do want some sour / bitter flavour in our coffee.

This may be especially pertinent if you wonder what impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the industry (hint: not a good one). Remember to keep supporting your favorite coffee businesses if you can - check out the weekly deal thread and the coffee bean thread if you're looking for new places to purchase beans from.

Industry folk, feel free to answer any questions that you feel pertain to you! However, please let others ask questions; do not comment just to post ""I am _______, AMA!” Also, please make sure you have your industry flair before posting here. If you do not yet have it, contact the mods.

While you're encouraged to tie your business to whatever smart or charming things you say here, this isn't an advertising thread. Replies that place more effort toward promotion than answering the question will be removed.

Please keep this thread limited to industry-focused questions. While it seems tempting to ask general coffee questions here to get extra special advice from ""the experts,"" that is not the purpose of this thread, and you won't necessarily get superior advice here.

16ynsi5,SCA's exclusionary practice ?,13,32,,"Just saw some of the pricing for competition entry in the country where I currently am. It's like $350 dollars. Someone in the thread said its actually one of the lower prices. Checked out a few other countries and I'm in shock at the costs to register for a competition?

Tbh none of my team would be able to pay that fee without feeling it in their pocket. Fortunate that our company covers the fee but it seems almost extortionate? 

As a ""non profit"" it seems counterproductive to spreading the gospel of specialty coffee or making coffee accessable to low income coffee professionals, which there are many of especially in less fortunate countries. 

Even their courses have become increasingly expensive, and as a result inaccessible to many. I suppose I could try write it off as an educational investment and there is value for money paid etc but when it comes to entering a competition, it just seems ridiculous. 

Ultimately, I don't think it's a appropriate for one organisation to have a chokehold on the ""standard"" of coffee globally. Just seems sketchy, and opertunistic.

16un5lr,A Word to the Wise About Coffee Scoring,187,62,self," 

Throwaway account for reasons. Many people know about the 100 point scale the SCA uses to grade coffees. Here's a breakdown of the scoring system according to the SCA:

&#x200B;

**Total Score Quality Classification**

**90-100 Outstanding**

85-89.99 Excellent

80-84.99 Very Good

<80.0 Below Specialty Quality

&#x200B;

This scale is obviously subjective, as any assessment of quality can't be boiled down to a single number without some inherent flaws/bias. However any Q Grader (AKA sommeliers of the coffee world) worth their weight in coffee will try their very best to assess coffee in the most objective way possible. There is a huge focus in the Q grader program on calibration so that even if the score of a coffee isn't a perfect representation of its quality, at least all the Q graders will be roughly in the same range. That way, their scores can be used to grade green coffee and provide insight to roasters and consumers.

&#x200B;

Its probably worth diving into Arabica Q grading in a bit more detail but for brevity's sake ill leave that up to you by linking some information here: [https://sprudge.com/what-is-a-q-grader-for-coffee-194426.html](https://sprudge.com/what-is-a-q-grader-for-coffee-194426.html)

&#x200B;

Most coffees that you're likely to buy in the specialty coffee world fall in the range of 83-88 points. Its hard to say exactly, but having worked in the industry for a long time, I would confidently say less than 5% of specialty coffees fall in the 90+ range. And way less than 1% fall in the 95+ range. Specialty coffee roasters like to think that they all have at least 85+ coffee, and that may be true for some, but that's just not the reality for most. Coffee is an agricultural good with extreme variability in one lot to another, one crop year to another, and so forth. So there is just no way for exporters and importers to supply the whole specialty market with such extraordinary coffees consistently.

&#x200B;

Much like the world of wine with its own 100 point scale, there are famous review houses. In wine, you might be familiar with reviewers like Robert Parker, James Suckling, Wine Spectator, etc. And if you see a 90+ point score printed proudly on a bottle, you are probably more likely to buy it. So due to the financial incentive to get a high score on your wine, there have also been review houses like Luca Maroni, who consistently score much higher than other reviewers on the same wines. Here's a good video covering that whole issue: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKvv30LmLzw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKvv30LmLzw)

&#x200B;

Now that we have some background on the topic, here's the PSA:

In coffee, there are not many of these review houses. The only one of any notoriety is called Coffee Review. Coffee roasters will send their coffees to them, and pay them to review the coffee. Unfortunately, I think that the lack of clarity around the scoring system and the lack of oversight has infected their scores with pretty insane inflation.

&#x200B;

I analyzed all the scores on the first 100 pages of their website, aka 7336 publicly available reviews, and the average mean score was **91** points. The median was **92** points. The mode was **93** points. In fact, over 77% of the coffees reviewed received a score over 90 points and only 6% of coffees received a score lower than 85 points.

&#x200B;

Even taking into account that roasters may only send Coffee Review the coffees that they're most proud of, this does not explain such a high average score, at least if going by SCA standards.

&#x200B;

Anecdotally speaking, I know of a roaster who sent them a coffee that was over 2 years old past crop and had been receiving many complaints, and it received a 90 point score. I've also heard stories of K-cups receiving 90+ scores. Lastly, the score-flation of CR is something I hear Industry people talk about all the time in private conversations.

&#x200B;

I'm not trying to completely discredit them by any means, and I'm sure that their scores are still insightful in a relative way (for example a 95 being better than a 94, etc.) To their credit they list their own way of interpreting their scores on their website, that differs slightly from the SCA system:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5jhsjkkdd1rb1.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d317754dc8b7abb294680905437e5d1a11dc0c6

&#x200B;

I'm only trying to advise consumers to take ALL point scores that you might see on websites or on bag labels, from Coffee Review or elsewhere, with a big grain of salt. Ultimately, you should only trust your own palate to be the judge on whether or not you like a coffee.

16ukg5g,Non-Dairy & Dairy Milk Frothing Experiment: Results,35,35,,"I decided to go ahead and buy several frothing machines, and as many milks as I could fit into my fridge - turned out to be twelve lol. 

My notes are at the bottom. If anyone would like me to test a different milk in the Bodum, Aeroccino4, or Subminimal let me know. If I am able to find it here in south Florida I’d be happy to test it out. 

*(My favorite thus far is the Pacific Foods Barista Soy. It was *perfect*. Completely neutral, somewhat sweet taste. Really, really good.)*



—Silk Organic Soy (green, fridge box):

- Bodum: Very nice. Lots of thick, firm, small bubble foam. 

- Secura Detachable: Not good at all. Watery, thin, some large bubbles. Like dish soap.



—Minor Figures Oat Barista (white, fridge box):

- Bodum: Not good. Larger bubbles, thin, watery. 

- Secura Detachable: Good. Lots of light, small froth.

- Capresso (WARM)(135): Poor. Bubbles were small/medium, medium, and medium/large. No real micro. Thin. Lots of milk, very little froth. 

- Zulay (microwaved 137°F): Not good. Very thin, with lots of milk left under the dishwater-style froth. Unstable. Really hard to get even the bubbles it made. 

 - Subminimal (microwaved 133*F): Poured like thinner paint. Some small bubble froth, but mostly microbubbles. Just OK. Smelled stronger than with the other frothers. 

 - Aeroccino4 (HOT button): Really disappointing. Came out looking much the same as it did when I started. Slightly thicker than when it was cold, but no foam or froth. Neutral smell. 


—Califia Farms Oat Barista (blue, fridge box): 

- Bodum: Nice. Sort of thin like paint, but good, small bubble froth. 

- Secura Detachable: Very nice. Thick paint, lots of tight, small bubbles throughout.



—Trader Joe’s Unsweetened Almond, Cashew & Macadamia (shelf box)

- Bodum: Awful. Dish-soap-style bubbles, thin, grey, watery.

Califia Farms Go Coconuts
- Secura: Awful. Thin, watery, grey, dish-soap-style bubbles. 



—Fairlife Whole Lactose-Free (red, fridge box)

- Bodum: Very nice. Great foam. Lots of small, luscious bubbles. Some medium bubbles. Thin paint viscosity.

- Secura Detachable: Great. Perfect foam. Thick paint viscosity. Lots of tiny bubbles. No medium or big bubbles at all. The best!



—Silk Soy Original (red, fridge box):

- Bodum: 155* Awful. Thin, watery, dishwater-like bubbles large, unstable bubbles that drifted apart, but didn’t pop too much.

- Capresso (HOT)(145*): Better than the Bodum. Took 3x as long. Bubbles were large and medium, loose froth. Unstable, but more stable than the Bodum’s, though they popped more than the Bodum’s did.

- Aeroccino4: Not good. Lots of dishwater-style large and medium/large bubbles. Watery. Smells unappetizing. Loose, watery, lots of milk underneath. Only small amount of froth. Unstable. 



—Chobani Oat Milk Original (yellow, fridge box)

- Bodum (155*): Nice. Some small/medium and small bubbles, mostly microfoam. Half milk/half foam. Stable. 

- Capresso (HOT)(165*): Much less bubbles than Bodum. Some larger and small and medium. Stable. Much more milk than foam - less foam than the Bodum. 
- Capresso (WARM)(125*): Very good. Lots more froth to milk ration than HOT. Froth is stable, pours like paint. Good micro bubbles with some small/medium bubbles throughout. 

- Aeroccino4: Beautiful pour. Some very small bubbles, but mostly microfoam. Not as thick as cow milk, but not as thin as soy. Smells neutral of oats. All foam, stable. 

- Subminimal Lithium: 4oz for 40 sec in micro to 134* Thin pour. All foam, some small/medium and small bubbles. Not bad. 



—Pacific Foods Barista Soy

- Bodum: Nice. Mostly microfoam, some larger and several medium bubbles. Some loose milk underneath, but majority was foam. Stable. 

- Aeroccino4 (Dense Hot): Perfect. Poured like thick paint. No big bubbles at all. Velvety, thick microfoam. Stable. No loose milk underneath. Beautiful pour.

- Zulay Handheld Frother (microwaved to 135*F): Beautiful. Lots of very fine microbubbles. Very nice pour. No milk on bottom. Very stable. Neutral smell. Really nice. The only downside is the Zulay flings the milk a bit at the top until you get it fully under the milk. Might help to have a taller jug. 


—Trader Joe’s Oat Beverage w/Pea Protein (shelf box)

- Bodum: Not great. Thin, watery, lots of small bubble foam. Some milk underneath.  Stable 

- Aeroccino4 (Dense Hot): Pretty good actually. Smells lovely. Lots of very small bubbles. Poured like good paint. Couple of small/medium bubbles. Overall nice, if looser, froth. Stable

- Capresso: Not good. Some medium/large bubbles. Many small bubbles. Thick froth. No milk underneath. Stable.



—Trader Joe’s Oat Beverage Unsweetened Vanilla (Pink, fridge box) 

- Bodum: Lots of different size bubbles, inconsistent. Small, medium, small/medium. thin. Smells very nice. Lots of milk underneath. Not very stable 

- Aeroccino4 (dense hot): Some small medium bubbles. Also a good amount of microfoam. Poured well surprisingly. Lots of milk underneath. Not very stable. 


—Lactaid Fat Free (purple, fridge box)

- Bodum: very nice. Some milk on the bottom. Smells nice. A few small/medium and medium bubbles, but mostly microfoam.

- Aeroccino4 (dense hot): Beautiful, thick microfoam. All microfoam. Some milk underneath. Stable. Poured well. Smelled nice.

- Suminimal Lithium: surprisingly lovely, if thinner, microfoam. Poured like nice paint. Heated 4oz in microwave to 130 degrees.  Separated out some milk after a few minutes, but still very stable. 


—Elmhurst Oat Barista (black label, fridge box).

- Bodum: Not bad. More small frothy bubbles rather than foam. Some small/medium bubbles. Somewhat stable. Neutral smelling.

- Aeroccino4: Really nice. Lots of good, thick microfoam. Only a few smaller bubbles, but poured really well. Stable foam. A bit of milk under the foam. Neutral smell, bit more oat forward than the one from the Bodum.

- Subminimal Li (heated to 138*F): There is a learning curve to this, so any larger bubbles are likely my fault. I’m working on it. That said, this frothed nicely. It poured like thick paint, and smells the most neutral of all three frothers. There was a bit more milk underneath than the Aeroccino, but again that could just be me. 


—Oatly! Barista Edition (grey , fridge box)

- Bodum: Thick pour, scattered small/medium and medium bubbles on top. Very oat smelling. Some milk under the froth. 

- Aeroccino4; Almost perfect. Bit of milk under the foam, but only a couple tiny bubbles. Really stable microfoam. Heavy oat smell. 

- Subminimal Li (heated to 130*F): Lots of small bubbles and froth. About half was extra milk. Again, I’m very new to the Subminimal so please take all of these as potential user error. 



—Califia Farms Almond Barista Blend (red top, shelf box)

- Bodum: Truly awful. Did not hold any foam, only large bubbles that disintegrated upon pouring. Very thin and watery. Does smell sweet and lightly nutty.

- Aeroccino4: Even worse than the Bodum, if possible. Bubbles were huge, and disappeared as I was removing the lid. Smelled the same as the Bodum. 

- Subminimal Li (heated to 132*F): The Subminimal worked the best of all the frothers. I was able to bring out some microfoam, but it was still very unstable and had lots of larger, frothy bubbles. (Again, could be user error as I’m new to the Subminimal). Smelled the best of all three. Warm and lightly sweet. Nicely fragrant.  

———————— NOTES —————————

I returned the Secura due to it squealing like a banshee. 

I returned the Capresso because it did not perform as well as the others, had a plastic jug, and took between three and five times as long as the Bodum to finish. It’s base also stayed hot for a really long time which meant you could only do HOT or WARM, but not HOT, then WARM unless you waited close to fifteen minutes. 

The Bodum was always the fastest, though not always the best. 

All milk was cold, right from the fridge.

I didn’t use any sugar for the tests. Just the milks. 

All machines were washed with hot, soapy water and dried after every test. 

I plan on repeating all the above with the Aeroccino4 on it’s other settings. I’ll update as I go.

Edit 1: I used the Bodum Bistro Electric Frother, The Nespresso Aeroccino4, and the Subminimal Lithium.

Edit 2: I added reviews for: Oatley!, Elmhurst, and Chobani Almond.

Edit 3: Added my findings for new Zulay Handheld Milk Frother ($12.99 on Amazon) for Minor Figures Barista Oat, and Pacific Foods Barista Soy milks. I also added my findings for the Aeroccino4 with the Minor Figures Oat Barista.  

* The Zulay was the cheapest at only $12.99 (from Amazon), and performed shockingly well. If you don’t want to spend a lot of money, or want something travel-friendly, get this one and spend some time learning how best to use it. 

(I also want to add that all of my purchases were made by me with my own money after doing my own research.

## GE (the very same) launch the ""Grind and Brew Coffee Maker""

## [Link](https://www.cafeappliances.com/grind-brew-coffee-maker)

https://preview.redd.it/yx3um0xuklqb1.png?width=638&format=png&auto=webp&s=20c8dfb084690497428ae2089d91b94afff3055f

General Electric has launched a new, extremely bougie, pourover and grind machine under their ""Cafe"" brand. For real, I am not making these names up. The company is called ""General Electric"" and they make general electrics. Their coffee brand is called ""Cafe"" and their new machine which both grinds and brews is called the errr ""Grind and Brew"".

[To be fair, anything is better than Lelit giving their ironing boards women's names and their grinders men's names...](https://twitter.com/MoonHeadCoffee/status/1704798399222927417)

At $280 dollars with a built-in grinder and a decent thermal mug, I think this is a pretty good deal for the right person. You would struggle to find a semi-decent burr grinder at this price so I can understand how anyone might think this is worth it.

However, for anyone trying to build a coffee setup for their home over time - this system would be a poor decision. If and when you want to upgrade part of your system you can't and will have to replace both your grinder and pour over system all in one.

One final thing - ignore the water filter. That filter is just 'activated carbon' and will make zero difference to water hardness. If you don't use bottled water you will end up with a great deal of calc and you'll need to replace the machine very soon... It's almost as if...

## Brazilian National Supply Company (CONAB) estimates a 7% growth in BR production

[**Link**](https://www.conab.gov.br/ultimas-noticias/5175-producao-de-cafe-esta-estimada-em-54-36-milhoes-de-sacas-3-maior-na-serie-historica)

Brazil's 2023 coffee harvest is making headlines with an estimated production of 54.36 million bags, marking a 6.8% increase over the previous year. Despite the negative biennial cycle, this harvest ranks as the third-largest in Brazilian history, trailing only 2018 and 2020. This data comes from the National Supply Company (Conab)'s third crop survey.

Arabica coffee takes the spotlight this year, projected to yield 38.16 million bags, thanks to a 2.4% expansion in production area and a significant 13.9% boost in productivity, aided by favorable weather conditions. Particularly impressive is Minas Gerais, the leading coffee-producing state, boasting a remarkable 29.5% production increase.

In contrast, conilon (related to Robusta) crops are expected to decline by 11% compared to 2022 due to adverse weather, particularly affecting Espírito Santo, the main conilon-producing state.

Brazil's coffee-growing area in 2023 stands at 2.24 million hectares, with 1.88 million hectares in production (a 1.9% increase) and 362.5 thousand hectares in formation (a 9.3% reduction).

While Brazil saw a 10.8% drop in coffee exports from January to August in 2023, the situation improved in August, indicating a potential export recovery in the coming months, driven by increased domestic supply.

# World Coffee Innovation Awards: 2023 shortlist announced

[An infographic of the nominees for the World Coffee Innovation awards](https://preview.redd.it/ufostxyvklqb1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c3042143315c446ace2f1889c808686964597c8)

Look, I know these awards are often marketing efforts by large companies but they can shine a light on some genuine innovations in the market.

In the category of Traditional Machine Innovation, several noteworthy contenders vie for recognition. Superkop stands out with its growing range of fully manual and non-electric machines. Notably, it boasts a wall-mountable design that combines aesthetics with functionality. Squeaky is nominated for Alsa - a portafilter-mounted ice-cold steel ball.

The Automatic Machine Innovation category mentions the ""Perfect Moose Jack,"" which is another automatic milk frother that can be hugely useful in high-flow commercial environments.

There are other products in the awards and I'll bring you the winners when they come out.

In this weekly thread, industry folk can post upcoming deals or other promotions their companies are holding, or promote new products to /r/Coffee subscribers! Regular users can also post deals they come across. Come check out some of the roasters and other coffee-related businesses that Redditors work for!

Note that this thread will be weekly at least for the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, since many roasters are running more specials than usual to drum up business.

We encourage everyone to post deals here especially since many roasters are holding specials to drive business affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. However, note that there will be zero tolerance for shady behavior. If you're found to be acting dishonestly here, your posting will be removed and we will consider banning you on the spot. If you yourself are affiliated with a business, please be transparent about it.

There are a few rules for businesses posting promotional material:

- You need to be active in /r/Coffee in a non-self-promotional context to participate in this thread. If it seems you are only here to promote your business in this thread, your submissions will be removed. Build up some /r/Coffee karma first. The Official Noob-Tastic Question Fest weekly thread, posted every Friday, would be a good place to start, and check out what is on the Front Page and jump in on some discussions. Please maintain a high ratio of general /r/Coffee participation to posts in this thread.

- If you are posting in this thread representing a business, please make sure to request your industry flair from the mods before posting.

- Don't just drop a link, say something worthwhile! Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!

- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.

- No crowdfunding campaigns (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc). Do not promote a business or product that does not exist yet. Do not bait people to ask about your campaign. Do not use this thread to survey /r/Coffee members or gauge interest in a business idea you have.

- Please do not promote affiliate/referral programs here, and do not post referral links in this thread.

- This thread is not a place for private parties to sell gear. /r/coffeeswap is the place for private party gear transactions.

- Top-level comments in this thread must be listings of deals. Please do not comment asking for deals in your area or the like.

- More rules may be added as needed. If you're not sure whether or not whatever you're posting is acceptable, message the mods and ask! And please, ask for permission first rather than forgiveness later.",menschmaschine5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/16r7qha/mod_the_official_deal_thread/

16r1var,Mythos Climapro constantly jamming with dust despite replacing several parts,1,1,,"A very reputable technician in my city replaced the burrs 2 months ago (titanium), and the start/run capacitor (2 weeks ago), and I replaced the clump crusher last week (teeth are folded correctly and not obstructing chute). 

The parts alone cost over $1,000 and the tech is quite expensive as he charges for a full hour for the first hour. I’m worried I’m going to total the grinder if I keep spending money on it, and I’m worried this capacitor ($450) will fail again if it keeps jamming. 

We have to take it apart mid-shift, sometimes more than once per day, and there is very fine dust gathering around the outside of the burrs, preventing them from rotating. 

Simonelli suggested replacing clump crusher which I did, and it is absolutely folded and inserted correctly. 

What am I missing? It’s driving my staff crazy and it’s frustrating that all these expenses haven’t fixed the problem.

## La Marzocco Launch the Pico - A Home Grinder

## [Link](https://home.lamarzoccousa.com/product/pico/)

https://preview.redd.it/fa4sjixvu7pb1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=709ddedc2d4d6618967a88165cc982c9410f44e0

As predicted in last week's post, the new Pico grinder is out now. This retail grinder is heavy on style but perhaps a little light on substance - we shall see.

Marzocco continued their unusual naming schedule using unit prefixes (La Marzocco Zebi when?) with this new unit wieghing in at a substantial $1000. Marzocco managed to calculate that as and errrr €1000 in Europe. Interesting maths there but Marzocco isn't the only company ignoring fx rates these days.

For that much money, you're up against some serious machines like the Eureka Atom or the Sanremo Allground which both have flat burrs and stepless adjustments. Flat burrs tend to produce a more precise grind\* and, stepless adjustment lets you take advantage of that precision by dialing in with detail.

That said, it's a good-looking device and if it's high quality and quiet then I believe it will perform well for a certain type of person.

\*Essentially, two flat burrs only need to achieve parallelism but they don't need to be perfectly centrally aligned. Whereas conical burrs need to be both parallel and perfectly centrally aligned to get high precision.

## Specialty Coffee Association Launches the SCA Skills Diplomas

The SCA will be retiring their existing SCA Coffee Diploma (sometimes known as the 100-point diploma) in favour of these new specialised qualifications. That diploma will be fully phased out by 2024 but will continue to be recognised after that.

Each of the diplomas will be issued to applicants who have completed the relevant underlying courses and apply online.

## UK-Based 92 Degrees raising an additional £3m for growth

I haven't yet personally had the chance to drink any coffee at 92 Degrees and I think that speaks to their interesting (and successful) strategy here in the UK. As a proud ""soft southerner"" operating in a tiny band of our country 92 degrees have passed me by as they rapidly expanded in the growing northern cities.

I'll spare you guys a lecture on why UK Northern Towns and Cities are underrated and undervalued by UK businesses but 92 Degrees is yet more proof.

With 11 locations, none further south than Liverpool, they've grown using a previous £1.1 million investment. I expect great things here.

In this weekly thread, industry folk can post upcoming deals or other promotions their companies are holding, or promote new products to /r/Coffee subscribers! Regular users can also post deals they come across. Come check out some of the roasters and other coffee-related businesses that Redditors work for!

Note that this thread will be weekly at least for the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, since many roasters are running more specials than usual to drum up business.

We encourage everyone to post deals here especially since many roasters are holding specials to drive business affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. However, note that there will be zero tolerance for shady behavior. If you're found to be acting dishonestly here, your posting will be removed and we will consider banning you on the spot. If you yourself are affiliated with a business, please be transparent about it.

There are a few rules for businesses posting promotional material:

- You need to be active in /r/Coffee in a non-self-promotional context to participate in this thread. If it seems you are only here to promote your business in this thread, your submissions will be removed. Build up some /r/Coffee karma first. The Official Noob-Tastic Question Fest weekly thread, posted every Friday, would be a good place to start, and check out what is on the Front Page and jump in on some discussions. Please maintain a high ratio of general /r/Coffee participation to posts in this thread.

- If you are posting in this thread representing a business, please make sure to request your industry flair from the mods before posting.

- Don't just drop a link, say something worthwhile! Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!

- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.

- No crowdfunding campaigns (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc). Do not promote a business or product that does not exist yet. Do not bait people to ask about your campaign. Do not use this thread to survey /r/Coffee members or gauge interest in a business idea you have.

- Please do not promote affiliate/referral programs here, and do not post referral links in this thread.

- This thread is not a place for private parties to sell gear. /r/coffeeswap is the place for private party gear transactions.

- Top-level comments in this thread must be listings of deals. Please do not comment asking for deals in your area or the like.

- More rules may be added as needed. If you're not sure whether or not whatever you're posting is acceptable, message the mods and ask! And please, ask for permission first rather than forgiveness later.",menschmaschine5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/16l76kj/mod_the_official_deal_thread/

16iiwdb,V60 Filter Testing Results,40,37,,"Mods, I also posted this in r/pourover, feel free to delete if it shouldn't be in both places.

People always seem to love the Cafec Abacas and we've never really liked them all that much, so we thought it would be a good time to re-test. We used [our bloom + two pour V60 recipe](https://www.vibrantcoffeeroasters.com/v60), full strength Third Wave Water, our Ethiopia Keramo Village coffee (we picked Ethiopia specifically so that more fines would be generated and differences between filters would be magnified), and a Mahlkonig Guatemala grinder. Tasting was done blind, of course.

Tabbed Hario: 2:54 brew time. By far the most peachy and juicy. When hot seemed less floral but when cool got downright perfume-y. Big sweetness. Favorite by far.

White Abaca: 2:49 brew time. Juicy, clean, lots of florals when hot. When cool just a bit underwhelming.

Brown Abaca: 3:01 brew time. Thin, astringent, lacking sweetness and character.

Sibarist: 2:39 brew time. Very similar to white Abaca. Floral when hot. Clean. A nice brew, just not as juicy and sweet as the tabbed Hario.We also tried the Sibarist at a finer grind as we wondered if the very fast extraction was preventing us from getting as much of the fruit sweetness. Brew time did increase to 2:46 but flavor did not improve and it got more astringent. Perhaps actually grinding coarser and getting an even faster extraction would be better.

Our thought was that for a very low-fines grinder, the tabbed Hario is best, but that the results may be very different for a good but not outstanding grinder. So we tried again, using a Comandante, and added a few more filters to the comparison. Same brew recipe, but using our Ecuador Finca Los Girasoles Natural Caturra.

Tabbed Hario: 2:41 brew time. Nice, round, sweet, the most “Kenya” flavor (grapefruit, strawberry, currant, very slightly savory, basically the reason we love this coffee is because it tastes like a great washed Kenyan), brightest & juiciest. This was our clear favorite.

Brown Abaca: 2:40 brew time. Some “Kenya” taste, balanced, a little underwhelming compared to tabbed Hario.

T90 Med-Dark: 2:36 brew time. Very sugar-browning forward, thick, sweet, not very fruity or juicy.

Cafec Traditional: 2:43 brew time. Brighter & fruitier than both Abacas but the most astringent. Like grapefruit pith & rind rather than juice.

White Abaca: 2:29 brew time. Nice, balanced, some “Kenya” flavor, thinner and more bland than brown Abaca.

Sibarist: 2:03(!!) brew time. Very light mouthfeel, bright but lacks sweetness. We also tried 23 clicks for this, 2:18 brew time, thicker & rounder but too astringent.

Conclusion: the tabbed Harios are the best for our light roast coffees. The Abacas are a decent alternative. We do not recommend any of the others. That said, it is still entirely possible that for other coffees, other brew recipes, other grinders, and other personal preferences in flavor, some of these filters that we don’t much care for could be best. That’s a big part of the fun in coffee!",VibrantCoffee,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/16iiwdb/v60_filter_testing_results/

16i3g2r,Experiments on very long immersion brews,13,12,,"The theory behind immersion brewing is that the majority of extraction happens within the first 2-4 minutes. Extraction rate drastically falls off as brew temperature falls and coffee-water concentration gradient equalizes. 

However I have been noticing that the flavor profile still changes as brew time goes past 10 minutes. Here is my setup:

**Equipment:** Aeropress w/ Flow Control Cap

**Coffee:** Medium roasted, Guatemala. Ground medium fine (10 on Baratza Encore)

**Water:** Brita filtered tap water, 200 F

**Brew Method:** 15g Coffee : 200g Water. No stir. Pour in water, insert plunger, wait at varying brew times, and then \~30s slow plunge.

&#x200B;

**Results**

5 min brew: Smooth, with balanced acidity.

10 min brew: Just a hint of acidity. Sweetness increases, and flavor of the roast intensifies.

20 min brew: No acidity. Roast flavor falls off, and the cup becomes predominantly sweet.

40 min brew: Amazingly sweet cup. But flavor nuances becomes muted. 

&#x200B;

Does anyone else have experience with very long immersion brew times? What is the reason why the flavor profile continues to change, despite the extraction rate essentially dropping to 0?",blahz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/16i3g2r/experiments_on_very_long_immersion_brews/

# First seeds from the Innovea Global Coffee Breeding Network now germinating around the world

[Link](https://worldcoffeeresearch.org/news/2023/innovea-seeds)

https://preview.redd.it/0xrrw1uvqtnb1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5579d0275648cbb34a17c596455597be88dc226

The Innovea breeding program launched in late 2022 as a response to the challenges posed to global coffee varieties by climate change and the lack of progress from national breeding programs.

There are nine global breeding partners all over the world and seven of them have received their seeds for germination, with the remaining two (Indonesia and India) to receive theirs next growing season. 5000 trees will be planted, each with their own unique genetic code in an effort to explore which new varieties will perform best.

World Coffee Research will work with partners to select trees for planting and gather performance data. Field performance and genetic data will be combined for new breeding cycles, ensuring continual improvement in coffee agriculture.

# Reddit Thread on how to get weed smell out of a grinder...

[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/16bjjj3/how_to_get_weed_taste_out_of_grinder/)

https://preview.redd.it/g4r7xpt3rtnb1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=4577201dad43a67f7ca0c70662f6bf9efe250e2f

Genuinely a very interesting thread discussing how to undo this (understandable) weed-based mistake. My guy couldn't find his regular grinder and in a fit of innovation decided he would use his in-built coffee grinder to achieve the perfect blunt.

In terms of actually cleaning this poor machine - suggestions included: coffee, vodka, isopropyl, uncooked rice and basically 'good luck'.

In the end, the answer was very boring. Take the damn thing apart and clean it piece by piece with a toothbrush. Who would have thunk it? The problem was that the brother was drinking weed-infused coffee while he was trying to solve the problem.

# Diletta Bello+ Goes On Sale

The new Bella+ looks great and is nice to see on the market. It's a single-boiler PID controlled unit with E61 Grouphead and a heat exchanger. It's retailing at around 1900 USD which puts it in competitive category of home machines.

The ECM Classika has a PID and single boiler but lacks the heat exchanger. That heat exchanger will give you 'fresher' water and allows for greater steam pressure after a shot has been pulled. They are a fair bit cheaper at \~1200 GBP.

The closest machine is probably a Profitec Pro 500 that has the heat exchanger and PID inbuilt as well and retails for similar prices. There's some additional shot programming available on the Bella+ which may tip it for some buyers.

16ez4km,Impressions from the Vienna Coffee Festival 2023,73,14,,"I went to the Vienna Coffee Festival this Saturday. I wasn't sure what to expect.

The main topic of the show were coffee roasters. Most of the local coffee roasters, some regional roasters and also big coffee brands were present. People were very friendly and you were able to taste coffee brews that interest you from a fairly wide selection. I would say that the biggest focus was on single origin pourover brews, with espresso second. One roaster even advertised with ""Recommended by James Hoffman "" Decaf is not a trend, with most roasters hesitant to show off their decaf roasts. On the other hand,  alternative milk and coffee water was a big topic there. I liked one of the oatmilks and will try to see if I can manage to steam them at home. I didn't drink much pourover before but I liked the naturally processed but not too fermented fruity pourover and medium roast hazelnutty espressos. Prices for beans ranged from 15€ to 75€ per kg, but I couldn't say that I had a strong correlation between personal taste preference and price. I could see oatmilk working better for lighter roast milk drinks, but I need to try first.

The main gear sponsor was La Marzocco, almost all stands were using their machines to demo their coffee. For grinders Mahlkönig was the dominant popular brand, with some Eurekas thrown in. There was one stand by Slayer x Weber Workshop. They did a demo shot using the EG1 for me. I wasn't blown away with how the motor sounded, and the coffee was too acidic and bright for my taste. At a stand from a regional gear vendor/distributor I was able to compare the Turin grinders next to some Eurekas and Mahlkönig and ended up buying a DF64V after coming away impressed with the look and feel. The DF83 was much bigger than I expected. The vendor mentioned how Eureka  could have done much better with their single dose models. He will check out the sculptors once they become more available but I needed a grinder now and not in 3+ months and he gave me a small rebate.

There were a bunch of barista classes available. I got a voucher for a 4 hour class recently, so I didn't look into it further. There was also a origami dripper and rca roasting competition show at the event.

The event tried to empathize sustainability, both in terms of sourcing coffee, roasting and packaging. 

I highly recommend going to this event if you want to test and compare coffee from different roasters.

169exjm,How long do burrs last for filter coffee?,59,49,,"Ok, this is both specific to my use case but also general. But happy to provide my details as a start point. 

I estimate that I go through between 28 and 30 pounds, (13-14kg) coffee per year. I've used a comandante c40 mk4 until now and am adding an ode gen 2 w/ssp mp burrs this week. 

No espresso, pourover only and I tend to go a bit coarse but I would say pretty average grind size. I just have very low tolerance for bitter astringent cups.

You may want the number of clicks on the c40. No idea. 1 click coarser than bitter. I can figure it out if it's important. 

Question ❓ is how long will either of these burrs last? I would have to guesstimate that the c40 already has ground about 65#/30kg.

How long do they generally last? Do they last longer as the size changes? I would suspect that as you grind much finer for example, espresso that that would have a meaningful impact on the burrs' life not sure about what 1 click would do if anything. Do different types of burrs have a lot different lifespan? Like 64mm flat vs 98mm, or conical vs flat or comandante vs 1zpresso, vs baratza vs other electrical grinders? Are there any rules of the road? Flats last x pounds for filter... Espresso will wear out a burr x times faster than filter...

166be6j,How to get proper extraction from a lower strength Aeropress recipe?,11,26,,"I enjoy my Aeropress, and I am able to make a really good mock-espresso with it. It’s delicious, strong, and perfectly extracted. The only downside is that is uses quite a bit of coffee, at 20 g coffee to 64 g water (1:3.2 ratio!).

I have tried time and time again to make a filter-style coffee with my Aeropress that gives me a lower strength brew. Something that has that same fruity, slightly acidic flavor, but at a lower strength. But I have never been able to achieve proper extraction. It seems that no matter how I set my grind size, my temperature, my coffee/water ratio, my brew time, etc…it always comes our tasting like garbage. It’s driving me insane.

I have tried many recipes online, including James Hoffmann’s “ultimate” Aeropress recipe. I can’t get any of them to work for me. The only way I have ever been able to get proper Aeropress extraction is by doing a mock-espresso recipe. Which again, I love, but sometimes I wish my 250 g bag of coffee would last a little longer…

Does anyone have any suggestions? I have a 1ZPresso Q2 hand grinder and Baratza Virtuoso+ electric grinder. I am able to dial both in well for my mock-espresso recipe. The coffee I’m buying is all high quality single origin light and medium roasts from a local roaster. I waffle back and forth between bottled mineral water and making my own water using the SCA recipe (i.e. mixing baking soda and epsom salt with distilled water). So I don’t think my equipment or base ingredients are to blame. 

I think it comes down to my grind size (which I know I am not a master at). For some reason I can start from an online recipe suggestion and dial in a fine grind size pretty quickly for the mock-espresso recipe, but if I try to do the same with a filter-style recipe that calls for a lower ratio and a coarser grind size…no matter what I do I can never dial it in. 

Any suggestions are welcome. I’m at my wit’s end here!",DariusBodarius,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/166be6j/how_to_get_proper_extraction_from_a_lower/

- If you are posting in this thread representing a business, please make sure to request your industry flair from the mods before posting.

- Don't just drop a link, say something worthwhile! Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!

- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.

1610fdo,Brewed cup from fines - different than expected,33,19,,"As the title suggests I brewed a cup from collected fines that tasted better than imagined, but not great. This was purely out of my curiosity.

I had \~17 grams of fines collected, for this very reason, that I have gotten from using my Fellow Shimmywhich uses a 200-micron sieve. Sadly I don't remember which two coffees these are from, but both were on the light to med-light roast level. 

I brewed using an Aeropress with Prismo attachment (metal + paper filter) with 200ml at 205ºF. The recipe was simple; pour all the water, strongly stir, and press after 1 minute. There was quite a bit of resistance, which makes sense. 

I expected a one-note bitter/harsh cup, but the result was way more complex than I expected. There was some sweet fruitness still present with a nice acidity as well. I would not call it an overly enjoyable cup because there is still some harshness present. It is good enough that it makes me want to try this again, maybe using a different ratio or only using fines from one coffee.",jdtomchick,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1610fdo/brewed_cup_from_fines_different_than_expected/
161394s,Been brewing coffee wrong since the past couple of years due to the TDS of my water! Advice needed!,9,4,,"A bit of an extensive, in depth post regarding water for coffee with a story as well;

About a couple of weeks back, I was travelling and took my AP along with me which I used to make coffee with the same beans I was using back at home, used bottled water and IMMEDIATELY was taken aback by how much more intense and flavourful albeit a bit too strong for my personal taste but still was able to actually taste the flavour notes so vividly and I realised at that moment that something is not right back at home(been brewing since the past 2 years or so which makes this quite sad lol), at that moment I started researching about water and TDS and the sorts

When I reached back home, I used a TDS meter for my water which I’ve been using since the past couple of years for my coffee and it was 290, TWO NINETY, and from the knowledge I had, I knew that there was no way I was extracting the flavours which I’ve always wanted to since a long time, most of my brews were subtle, tasted decent but nothing which popped off and I went down the rabbit hole to upgrade everything by for not even a second I thought it must’ve been the water

So I started experimenting with different waters available and luckily my RO has a mechanism where I can adjust the TDS, brewed with multiple bottled waters and ended up with one with a TDS of around 85, then thought of playing around with the RO and changed the TDS to around 85 similar to the bottled water and I thought yup, finally it’ll be similar, NOPE, the bottled water clearly tasted way more flavourful than my RO with the same TDS and I knew it was the mineralisation so I stuck with bottled water for a bit until recently where I’ve been having a hard time getting used to the very intense, acidity forward cups I’ve been making with it although definitely way more flavourful than my previous RO w a TDS of 290

So the recommended TDS according to the SCA is around 150 so I tuned my RO to around 150 and made a cup and it was a lot sweeter, more full bodied although lacked that punch which isn’t necessarily a bad thing but was definitely better than what I’ve been brewing the past week or so

So I’m like okay perfect, let’s stick to this now but my curiosity got me measuring the TDS of the water at a higher temperature and it was around 200?? I noticed that most of the articles doesn’t mention the temperature of water when they check the TDS which made me even more confused!!

Any advice as to at what temperature to check the TDS as well as what water TDS has helped with your brews?

Thank you and I apologise for the long post 

TL;DR: Been brewing since 2 years with water with a TDS of 290, switched to bottled(TDS 80) but found the taste quite punchy and acidity forward, tuned my RO to a TDS of around 150 which made a nice, all rounded cup but checked the TDS at a higher temperature and it was around 200??!!",AnonymousButForWhat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/161394s/been_brewing_coffee_wrong_since_the_past_couple/

15yx48z,Cold Brew Ratios Experiment Results,102,47,self,"https://imgur.com/a/f82p7yT

I had posted about max saturation of cold brew and asked about what ratios other people had tried and their results. With that information I decided to do a little experiment. 


I used 100g of medium grind coffee and made the following ratios: 1:6.3, 1:4, 1:2.63 (this was supposed to be 1.5, but my hand slipped as I was pouring). 1.63 is my go-to ratio. I let them sit at room temperature for 21 hours and then strained them with my Toddy. I let each one drain for 20 minutes.


In the second picture you can see the amount of coffee that each ratio yielded. I think the discrepancy in starting vs ending amount of liquid would be a lot less if each coffee had been brewed in the Toddy instead of being dumped in, as the liquid would have sank to the bottom. 

First I tasted each one individually without diluting. The 1:63 was much lighter and weaker than the 1:2.63, as expected. The 1:2.63 was very strong, but not bitter. The 1:4 was closer in strength to the 1:2.63.

Finally I heated them up and diluted them with a 1:2 ratio of coffee to steamed milk. This is where the differences really shined. In the picture you can see the clear difference in color between the 1:6.3 and the 1:2.63. The 1:6.3 tasted way too watered down with that amount of milk in my opinion, almost a typical coffee shop latte ratio. The 1:4 was very balanced and I think would be ideal for many people. The 1:2.63 was PERFECT to me, like a strong latte. It tasted amazing!


So in conclusion if someone is going to dilute the concentrate with water I'd recommend a ratio of 1:6. If you are going to dilute with milk and are going for a more espresso-strength concentrate then I would 100% recommend a ratio between 1:2.5 and 1:4. I'm personally going to try 1:3 and see how much concentrate I get with a bigger volume. 


Hopefully this will be helpful to others! Also I would really love if someone could make the 1:2.5 and test the TDS, I'm still super curious as to what it would be.",PuzzledBanana2207,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/15yx48z/cold_brew_ratios_experiment_results/

15ullxe,Official plumb in kit for Linea Micra DOES exist,55,20,,"So I work for a coffee shop doing maintenance and we had suggested a LM Linea Micra to a customer under the pretense that it could be plumbed in (since their website says so). Once we got it and tried buying the kit we realized it wasn't available. We had some very frustrated phone calls with the tech support that basically just said ""well, it's not available, so sorry"". After asking to return the machine they told us that it is available outside the US and they were going to have one shipped overnight. This is the official kit. From what I was told the only reason it isn't available yet is because the production of the custom fitting that attaches to the flowmeter is stalled. Aside from that, everything else is the same as the linea mini kit. The jumper for the water reservoir is actually included with the micra and is attached underneath the two springs.",nortron23,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/15ullxe

## Equipment

* [Acaia release their new grinder](https://acaia.co/collections/coffee-grinders/products/orbit?variant=43938011939044)

*Pretty decent Weber EG1 dupe.*

* [Fellow launch a collaboration with Big Face (founded by Jimmy Bitler of the NBA)](https://fellowproducts.com/pages/bf-fw-lift-off)

*Mostly this is just a celebrity branding operation for existing Fellow products but the Pelican case for Fellow equipment might be interesting for the right person.*

* [Barista Attitude launch a commercial single-boiler machine called The Pilot.](https://dailycoffeenews.com/2023/08/09/barista-attitude-pilot-espresso-machine-cleared-for-takeoff/)

*This is not a joke or a bit - I will buy an ion beam. Spraying coffee with water is now officially for people who don't own ion beams.*

*What do you mean you don't use an ion beam on your grinder setup?*

*They missed a trick not calling it an Ion Cannon. The nostalgia for Command and Control who have driven sales if you ask me.*

This may be especially pertinent if you wonder what impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the industry (hint: not a good one). Remember to keep supporting your favorite coffee businesses if you can - check out the weekly deal thread and the coffee bean thread if you're looking for new places to purchase beans from.

Industry folk, feel free to answer any questions that you feel pertain to you! However, please let others ask questions; do not comment just to post ""I am _______, AMA!” Also, please make sure you have your industry flair before posting here. If you do not yet have it, contact the mods.

While you're encouraged to tie your business to whatever smart or charming things you say here, this isn't an advertising thread. Replies that place more effort toward promotion than answering the question will be removed.

Please keep this thread limited to industry-focused questions. While it seems tempting to ask general coffee questions here to get extra special advice from ""the experts,"" that is not the purpose of this thread, and you won't necessarily get superior advice here.

I would turn it off with the button and a few moments later it would turn on again.

It can be random and I’m just sitting in my chair watching TV and it would just start spinning up.

15oex9n,2023 Panamanian Auction Coffee: Cheaper due to quality or economy?,3,8,,"A group of friend and I ordered some samples from the Esmeralda, Elida, and BOP auction for this year because we plan on having a friend who owns a coffee shop roast our lot for us (if we win) and give some away to family members who also love coffee while saving the rest for our own enjoyment.

This is our first time participating in a coffee auction and drinking auction lots with the intent of purchasing the whole lot. While our bid in the Esmeralda auction was ultimately outbid, we are still hoping to be able to purchase a lot in either the Elida or BOP auction if the price is right. 

Comparing the hammer price of the 2023 Esmeralda auction to that of 2022, I noticed a markedly reduced hammer price across the board (2022 prices was almost 2X that of 2023). I expect to see similar phenomenons with Elida and BOP auctions.

To the people who have had both 2022 and 2023 auction lot samples, do you think this decrease is a result of a poorer vintage or a slowdown in the economy?  Although the reduced price in 2023 means my friends and I could potentially afford to pool our funds together and purchase a lot, I dont think it’s wise for us to spend a lot of money getting 10 KG of sub-par auction beans if we can instead just buy bags of roasted auction lot beans during “good years”.",Disguised_Riches,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/15oex9n/2023_panamanian_auction_coffee_cheaper_due_to/

15gm00z,What does it take to work as a roaster?,52,39,,"I have been a coffee hobbyist for the longest time and have friends in the industry but have never tried to be a barista because I’m over working the service industry and having constant customer facing interaction. I also can’t do latte art.

I recently have had the opportunity to work as a roaster at one of my local shops. I always enjoyed the idea of a roaster, seeing them in the back with the computers and all the analytics and science which made me enjoy the methodical and scientific process of brewing coffee myself so much. (I mostly do pour over). I love how trial and error and numbersy dialing in my pour overs at home are and I feel I’d enjoy the process of being involved in the roasting of commercial beans.  

I’m asking what is it like working as a roaster? What does your day look like? Would it be advisable to take the job as a complete beginner with no experience in the coffee industry (again just a hobbyist)? What should I brush up on? Or do you recommend starting out the barista route at a cafe first?

Baristas have told me the job as a roaster is very different and very routine, repetitive and monotonous, which honestly sounds very appealing to me.",teamtwowheels,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/15gm00z/what_does_it_take_to_work_as_a_roaster/

I printed this insert because I was tired of forgetting the last grind setting I used, and as a result I was constantly turning it back to “zero” and counting the clicks back to where I wanted to grind. It’s just held in with a few pieces of doubled over scotch tape.

It works by aligning the sharpie mark with grind size 1. Now the dimple on the adjustment dial points towards your current grind setting. Obviously because there are more than 12 settings it means you could either be #3 or #15 (in the photo), but I almost always use this grinder for pourover or aeropress, so I can be pretty confident I’m not on setting #3.

Thought some of you might find this interesting, if people are interest ed I can try and upload the template.",intrepid_explorer,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/15fvw77/i_printed_a_grind_setting_insert_for_the_timemore/

I was told by the head barista to foam the milk very wet almost the same as a latte and everybody who works there thinks a 12oz cappuccino and an 8oz latte are absolutely ridiculous.

154ezj6,PSA: Wobbly Baratza Hopper While Grinding Could Mean Broken Adjustment Ring,37,19,,"My Baratza Encore hopper has been pretty wobbly during grinding for a couple of years now.  I could see it move side to side a bit while grinding but I couldn't really figure out the cause of the issue.

Well last week, my ring burr holder tabs broke off for the 2nd time in 2 years giving me super inconsistent grinds.  Half of the grind was French press and the other half was pourover.  My original ring burr holder lasted 10 years before it broke the first time and now 2 have broken within 2 years.

Well I decided to order an adjustment kit along with the replacement ring burr holder as it was only $6 and I was paying shipping anyway and my grinder is more than 10 years old anyhow.

After taking out the original adjustment ring and taking apart the small calibration screw to disassemble the adjustment ring, I found one of the three tabs on the inside broken!  The adjustment ring has 3 tabs on the inside just like the ring burr holder tabs that can't be seen unless taken apart.

Replacing everything, my Encore w/ M2 burr, grinds like a champ making coffee like I haven't had for years!

**TLDR: Check your adjustment ring integrity on your conical burr Baratzas by watching for hopper wobble during grinding - especially if you're breaking ring burr holders!**",mohammedgoldstein,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/154ezj6/psa_wobbly_baratza_hopper_while_grinding_could/

1535vb8,I cannot describe the taste profile of coffee beans,80,89,," I have been trying different coffee beans for about a year now, from commercial-grade robusta to specialty-grade arabica. However, I have noticed that I cannot describe the taste profile of the coffee beans that I drink. The most that I can get to describe coffee beans is just by their basic characteristics like acidity, sweetness, bitterness, roast level, body, and coffee type.  


 For example. I am currently drinking Gayo arabica from Aceh which I bought from a reputable roaster and was roasted about a week ago. From what I have observed, the roaster where I got my coffee from and other roasters described it as having a grape and chocolate taste profile. But, I cannot see it. I do taste it being sweet and acidic, but I cannot relate to the taste profile a lot of roasters have described. And this coffee bean is not the only one that I face a similar issue with. 

&#x200B;

 I have tried different coffee beans from different origins, processes, roasters, and price ranges. I also do cupping for every coffee bean that I bought and brew it using different methods with the best ratio and grind size.  I even tried to buy coffee beans without looking at the taste profile that the roaster has described to come up with my own description. However, I struggled, and the best that I can do is very vague, like ""fruit"", but not specific about what kind of fruit.

&#x200B;

 Any solutions? Do I have to upgrade my equipment, especially my grinder? (I am currently using 1Zpresso JX)

I've never shared these notes before but I was so impressed with the scene here in Mexico City (and especially the Roma area) that my notes grew longer and longer, and I thought, what the hell? I saw some previous posts about CDMX coffee here and since I come here looking, maybe someone in the future will be served who also is hunting in the city.

&nbsp;

**What I like**

I like fancy pantsy expensive coffees.  Some part of my broken-ass brain gets excited when some hipster shop wants me to pay $30+ for 100g.  People get all bent outta shape about the roast, the water, Kalita vs v60, and tha's all cool but I strongly feel that the forgotten ingredient in coffee is, brace yourself... the coffee.  Without great coffee to roast, brew, serve, there's gonna be a ceiling on how good it can ever be.  That said, if you made your own loaf of bread and you  think it'll make great toast, you'd never toast it so dark that you can't taste the special bread you made cause then you could've just used wonder bread ffs!  So yes I like light roasts but not so light that the sugars on the bread/ in the coffee don't even caramelize (so sweet).  I also have been favoring natural processed coffees lately.  I wasn't always this way.  Like a lot of people I think natural Ethiopian coffees blew my mind 7-8 years ago but as I developed a palate I came to prefer the subtitles in washed coffees to the muddiness of loud naturals.  Nowadays I feel like naturals are getting cleaner and cleaner and are far more subtle than ever before. So I'm kinda back into a natural phase and I like prominent fermentation in a cup. All this is just so you know whether or not to trust my judgement/taste which might not be the same as yours.  

&nbsp;

**My method**

I usually order a cortado and a pourover.  This allows me to get a feel of both the skill of the baristas and the quality of the naked coffee.  To be clear pourover is just the filter coffee norm for most shops.  If a shop prefers to do batch brew, they give it lots of love and attention, and they have a good amount of traffic so the batch doesn't sit forever, it's gonna probably be just as good if not better.  After all, a good batch brewer is just a big damn pourover and no barista can ever be as consistent as a finely programmed batch brewer.

&nbsp;

**Mexican Coffee and Mexico City**

I have not seen Mexican coffee in the states like this!  I rarely see alternative processing methods in Mexico coffees I've had in the US.  Every shop I went to had both washed and alternate processing methods, often including straight naturals, or else honey process, and even anaerobic/carbonic macerations (though I know these are probably overused and poorly defined terms much of the time).

I have travelled a fair bit since I've been a devotee of great coffee, not a ton.   When I do, I'm always looking for great coffee (that doesn't always work out of course and I also have a travel kit because the world is still learning what great coffee is, to my taste anyway). I'll tell you something that really struck me about Mexico though.  It is the first place I have travelled that has both a rich coffee production scene AND a rich coffee service scene!  I got the impression from locals that the service scene is a pretty new phenomenon, at least in its present form, and that eve 5 years ago it was not like this!  But I will say this:
**Mexico City is possibly the best town I have ever been in for coffee!** The only other contender I think was Portland and that was like 10 years ago.  Now I haven't been to the vast majority of cities in the world so I'm not gonna tell you where I have been and then you can just assume I haven't been to your favorite coffee town and I'm not just insulting it, k?

I drank so much coffee!  I got up before my family, who I travelled with and went hunting.  There was nothing great open before 7:30, with more opening at 8, and a few not till 9.  I often had coffee mid-day, and god bless you Mexico, most of these shops are open pretty late.  IMO, a late night cortado after a big meal is the pinnacle of civility and tragically very few restaurants do it well, yet (a note on that later).

&nbsp;

**The Cafes**
(with ratings on a 5 point scale)

I made a map, this was helpful for me when exploring the city so I could see what coffees were nearby wherever I went and make my poor family go there with me.  I might as well include it.  I included multiple locations of some cafes even if I only went to one.  I stayed in Roma so the vast majority of these are in that are but I also do get the impression that that's the main hipster coffee zone for the city.  And there are others here that I heard about but never made it to.

&nbsp;

Almanegra:

Cortado 4.8 fluffy subtle bright

Batch 4.7 natural Guerrero fruity boomsplosion!

I brought home a bag of this too, which is good because I am doubting myself again.  I thought this was amazing though.

*Home bag is great!  It's a natural from the Guerrero region (1st I've heard of that).  Great acidity and fermented notes.*


&nbsp;

Blend station: 

Cortado 4.5 though darkish but great acidity)

Pour over 4.3 (delicate acidity - Oaxaca natural)

I brought home a  back aged in white wine barrels!?! Oh Mexico!

*Wine finish was subtle.  Just supported overall fermentation taste.*


&nbsp;

Buna:

I met the owner here.  Beto is a lovely dude.  He toured me around the roastery and showed me the operation.  They're doing some very cool creative stuff, their own coffee,  lions main in coffees for brain health. They mostly do wholesale and mostly to restaurants.  That's so great to hear!  Damn, I wished restaurants in the states had an interest ion 3rd wave coffee.  All too often there is nothing but shitty coffee at the end of a gourmet meal in the US.  Wake up ding-bats!  Coffee is gourmet food too!

Cortado 4.5

Pour over 4 (washed Veracruz)


&nbsp;

Cardinal:

I went here a couple times on late night walks home from dinner.  Like from Marmota to my hotel (this information is not helpful to you, but it helps me keep track, sorry).

Cortado 4 (creamy, clean)

Pour over 4 (stronger extraction, good acidity)

&nbsp;

Chiquito

Cortado 3.8 a bit much milk, well textured, flavor ok
Pour over 3.5


&nbsp;

Con Stella:

Cortado 3.5 Dark.

Pourover (honey geisha Veracruz) 3.7

Tasted like this was a great coffee,  that was roasted to a profile that just doesn't suit me.  Pretty over roasted, to my taste.


&nbsp;

Cucurucho:

I heard a a lot of praise for this place.  I only went once and at the location I went to, they only had one coffee available for espresso drinks and pourovers. I might have caught them on an off night

Flat white 4 (they said they don't do cortados)

Pour over 3 

&nbsp;

Cumbe:


(Sorry no 'tado)
Pour over: 3.5 carbonic maceration, clean cup


&nbsp;

Curva: 

Cortado 3.7 good flavor, too hot for me, and a bit dark

Pour over: 3.4 Chiapas natural

(I have this joke in my mind about milk temperature.  I want the barista to touch my cortado to their cheek before they serve it to me.  If it's too hot to touch your cheek, it's too hot for my mouth hole!)

&nbsp;

Drip:

Cortado 4.5 

Pour over 4.3 (natural Veracruz)

*I brought bag home, another Veracruz natural.  It's not super fruity but the fermentation really comes through.  It's kinda boozy and I personally really dig that.* 

&nbsp;


Memorias café:

Cortado 4.3 perfect milk rounded flavor

Pour over: 4 Veracruz natural carbonic maceration 4 great berry smell a bit bitter/muddy


&nbsp;

Quentin:

This was the first coffee joint I hit and I was so stoked that I now don't know whether to trust my answers.   I had a profound conversation with a couple who were from Mexico and Australia and I'm sure it was the coffee that expanded our minds.  I took a bag home, let's see if it lives up to the hype?

Cortado 4

Pourover 4.8 (Blueberry bomb natural! I adjusted this down a notch 'cause I don't trust my memory.)


*The bag I brought home, A Natural Catura from Veracruz, totally stands up.  Damn, damn, that is good coffee.  I think my favorite of the trip.*

&nbsp;


Tormenta:

This is a food cart, practically a taco cart and the dude used a hand grinder for my pourover.  I've never seen that before!

Cortado: 4.7 creamy, crazy bright, even tart.

Pourover: 4 natural Veracruz, subtle, but very nice fermented notes",IWannaVoteFerStuff,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/151komw/mexico_city_coffee_praise_musings_and_resources/

14wvji7,Any coffee shops around you eliminate tipping and have it work out?,88,98,,"I know of a few shops over the last 5 years that eliminated tipping and raised prices by a similar amount, for reasons. (Normalizing wages, adding benefits, correcting values for products etc)

For the purposes of this thread, let’s assume the reason to eliminate tipping is to establish viable living wages for work, and get rid of the friction that certain customers have with the idea of tipped service work.

None of the places regionally near me have done this, so I don’t have a lot of info about “has this worked out for the shop?”

Do any of the shops near you “not take tips?”

If so, I’m super interested in how you feel that’s gone, from a consumer/enthusiast standpoint.

I “get” tipping economy. As a worker and as an employer, I understand why and how it works. There has been recent pushback seen all over social media etc, and so I’m re-examining how we (my place) might tweak a few things and make it not cost employees any income. Not really interested (just me... you do you) in getting into debating the pros and cons of tipping in general—I can just state that I don’t know anyone in service work currently, who is anti-tipping, so if I play with these numbers I have to make sure no one feels like they “lose.” So I’m super interested in learning if anyone out there knows current success stories. Very aware of places that raised prices right out of business, and places that had to switch back to tipping because of staff preferences.

Don’t worry about the idea of me letting a thought experiment mess with my team. We wouldn’t do a thing without them wanting to do a thing.

14vyq4e,"[MOD][META] Outcomes of polling, and next steps.",49,25,,"Heya dear friends of /r/Coffee - results from the polling two weeks ago.  

First off, I'm very sorry it's taken me this long - I had Some Shit come up IRL and wasn't able to do as much keyboard stuff as normal.  

**What the voting said:**

The basic summary is that you want us to do several things all at once; move somewhere else, reopen as normal, and continue some protest actions.  

By strict majority vote, mandate was overwhelming to try and move to a new platform, with a lot of those indicating some measure of protest against Reddit supporting that.  Second by absolute majority is a return to normal.  However, those numbers are dwarfed by all voices indicating support for protest measures - which was a split vote due to the options presented.  

Hard closure had the lowest overall support, ""some other measure of protest"" was second pick to a lot of other options on both sides but only makes up a clear decision within that scope - inference there is that soft protest is a preferred compromise, but not a first pick.  

Sentiment & voting does support a general resentment towards Reddit for their changes and their behavior, but a reluctance to let go of the community present - if not necessarily the same attachment to Reddit as a platform for it.  A lot of votes for both limited protest and for reopen expressed alike that losing this community felt like a punishment for users not in scale with its' impact on Reddit.  We have a lot of users from two clear demographics - very engaged with the site as a whole with coffee as a specific preferred focus, and absolutely not engaged with the site as a whole but here for coffee stuff.  

For those interested; Hard Reopen had the highest number of ""tourist"" votes, with Hard Closure being a close second.  Even when folks had to stick their account to their opinion, each of those options were interfered with by outsiders in scale dwarfing more moderate or measured opinions.  The two poles wouldn't have strictly cancelled out, but they were relatively equivalent numbers in the grand scheme.  

**What we'll be doing:**

Over the next few weeks, we're going to return to 'mostly normal.'  We're going to remain fairly restrictive, but as many folks pointed out - that's not actually different from before.  Mods will remain here, we won't storm off into the sunset or try to burn the community to the ground; we'll work to implement what this community has asked for over the time those tasks need to stand reasonable chances of success.  

Mods will begin approving posts for the frontpage that meet standards - however, to reduce workload and errors, we'll keep the filter aggressive and approve 'content' posts, rather than allowing everything and then removing the chaff as we had prior.  The majority of content submitted in the past two weeks has been the sort of content you've previously asked us to remove, so with the reduced flexibility of mobile modding being ass now, we'll need to be a little more proactive to ensure the front page meets standards.

We will turn off the filtering of comments, it did less good for maintaining the community and using automod to reapprove comments would break reply notifications at the same time.  We'll discuss internally turning on the system that locks old posts from voting or comments - it's been nice to have it off, but a lot of what happens there is spam and it's no longer as feasible to address that as consistently as we once did.  

We will look at alternative communities and platforms we could move to, and start making plans for ways to accomplish that move.  

**Migration**

It is my firm belief that any move needs to be ""carrot"" and not ""stick"" motivated.  We can't - realistically *or* ethically - simply force everyone out of this space and into that next one.  We'll need to do things differently and get creative and try to make it more rewarding to be *there* than it is *here*, while continuing to use this place as a stepping-off point for coffee on reddit, and as a venue to try and coax folks to our new home as well.  

Once we've settled on a place, we'll start changing various mod-post texts to reflect that there is a new home, that we recommend and are building.  Those are more likely to be reminders and recommendations attached to approved posts, not something attached to post removals like current Daily Question redirects.  

Just that, in that regard, this space will see more limited development effort over time as energy is focused on building and developing the next.  

Our recurring threads will be back; as we explore new venues some of those may or may not be among the early things we look at moving over.  Those are something that this community, collectively, has contributed to this platform that makes this platform worthwhile for other users, and the owners of this platform have indicated loud and clear they do not value those sort of contributions.

We haven't decided on a new home.  

I'm continuing to look at competitor platforms where we could go that aren't taking over an existing community but still offer the sort of space, vibe, and opportunities that Reddit did.  This thread is a good place to talk about those options, and we'll do another thread in a little bit to examine possible outcomes and alternatives.

14ac45y,[MOD] [Meta] Welcome Back - API Protest Discussion & Next Steps for /r/coffee,206,271,self,"#Welcome back /r/coffee!

Thanks for all your support & kind words while we were blacked out for the initial API protest.  We realize that several mobile apps don't display the ""why we're private"" message, so many folks did miss why the sub was closed.

**For context on why we were protesting**, what the changes are, and why they're bad - see [this huge post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/147cksa/why_the_blackouts_happening_from_the_beginning/); or [one](https://old.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1462xf1/mod_meta_rcoffee_will_be_going_dark_on_june_12_to/jntn14e/?context=3) of my [two](https://old.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/148tj69/off_topic/jo249nd/?context=3) summaries.  

##Next steps for this community aren't yet determined.   That's the question at the bottom of this post.

For the time being, filter is set to extra-aggressive, with all posts/comments filtered by default and only comments in this thread and today's Daily Question thread being allowed through automatically.

Mods took the community private on our own conscience and in light of multiple messages from community members encouraging us to join the protest.  We still believe in the protest and we're still upset about the disrespect Reddit is showing for it's community and its users.  

**As a protest and as a solidarity movement, [it was massive](https://old.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/).**  Thousands of subs shut down - us included - and the shutdown made national news several times over in more than one country.  The protest has attracted significant amounts of outside attention and has directly attracted [the notice of Reddit advertisers](https://www.adweek.com/social-marketing/ripples-through-reddit-as-advertisers-weather-moderators-strike/).  

**However, on Reddit's side, nothing happened.**  I wasn't expecting a silver-bullet type of result, but between the disastrous AMA, and the leaked internal communication - Reddit seems to firmly believe that they can simply ignore the protests and complaints, [and everything will blow over](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/13/23759559/reddit-internal-memo-api-pricing-changes-steve-huffman).

So where /r/coffee should go next is up for discussion.  This isn't a strictly ""majority vote"" matter, but your mod team's actions will be guided by community discussion and sentiment.  We'll keep things running for a few days  - at least - while this discussion occurs and then choose our next steps once we feel everyone has had a fair chance to weigh in and be heard.  Mods will weigh our consideration of feedback based on users' history within the coffee community - I'd hate to shut this place down permanent because people from the rest of reddit decided to put a finger on the scales. 

**Without further ado: Does the community want to …**

* go ""back to normal""?  

* close permanently?

* enter a ""restricted mode""?

* participate in [Solidarity Tuesdays](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/148ks6u/indefinite_blackout_next_steps_polling_your/ ""Note: ''Touch Grass Tuesday'' is a protest mode selected by some subs that aren't closing permanently, where they engage in protest content or closure each Tuesday.  Your author thinks that's a little soft for this community, but it is a good half-measure solution and does need mention."")? 

* something else entirely?  

Additionally, if we take any measures - what sort of timeline do you feel is appropriate to check in again, what sort of end-state clause should mods be looking for.  Obviously, if Reddit backpedals and reverts their API policy, we'd revert to normal and go back to previously scheduled normality - but thoughts on other outcomes.  

**Say your piece in the comments.  Please include your thoughts and sentiments, and any other ideas.** Be kind to one another, and be understanding that not everyone will support, or not support, the same outcomes that you prefer.   

Because the tone of this post is inevitably slanted by it's author, I've done my best to account my own biases, and share my thoughts, [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/14ac45y/mod_meta_welcome_back_api_protest_discussion_next/jo9mek1/).

I've been playing around with a new (or new to me anyway) aeropress brew method for the past week.           
         
24g coffee, medium-fine grind (10 on my Baratza Virtuoso)        
400g water          
         
Sounds pretty standard, right? What's different is that I'm dividing the water into four separate 100g infusions of the same grounds. Pour, stir ~15 seconds, plunge until I just hear the hiss of air, remove the plunger, and repeat until the final infusion when I press all the way.         
             
I have tinkered with using my aeropress as a zero-bypass dripper before, and the cups definitely tasted like they had higher extractions than my standard V60 pour-over brews. I found the process of pouring very gently so as not to agitate the bed, and waiting for it to slowly drain incredibly tedious though.         
          
Doing a multi-infusion brew seems to achieve a similar result, but with even better extraction because of the ability to have a finer grind and agitation, and it does so more quickly. The cups have been strong enough (note though, not over extracted) that I've been adding a 50g ice cube, both to cool it from ~70°C to ~50°C for instant comfortable drinking and to increase the water/coffee ratio from 16.66 to 18.75.

It is not my denomination, but a term actual coffee shops use for these methods. Alternative, here, is basically any coffee which is not espresso or espresso based (cappuccino, flat white, etc). 

Aside from alternative methods on being very popular, they are practically frowned upon and consider “weird”, “weak”, “dishwater” and such. It is also not consider „real coffee”. „Real coffee” is espresso, of course. 

What is the deal with this sentiment? I understand the popularisation of „Italian coffee culture”, but why are alternative brewing methods discredited as not real enough?

1453hlq,Hand grinder mod for use with stand mixer?,5,14,,"I've recently begun drinking coffee again, and—as much as I enjoy chewing through beans every morning with my ancient Pharos—the notion of motorizing a hand grinder with the help of a stand mixer has gripped my imagination. I'd like to use a stand mixer because I already have one that's taking up counter space, and it has a decent variable speed motor so I should be able to find a way to slowly grind even fairly hard beans.   


So my questions to you are: have you ever modded a hand grinder so that it can be used with a stand mixer? Which grinder and mixer did you use? How did it go?  


The stand mixer I have is a Kenwood chef. The vertical variable speed outlet takes attachments that can be twisted into place in the outlet. I think it may be possible to mod a grinder with a twist attachment or use one of Kenwood's adapters.   


I've seen people use motors with eg. the comandante, but that's out of my price-range for an experiment like this. The dimensions of the mixer and the Pharos are not quite compatible enough for an easy mod—I'd have to muck about with gears and some sort of frame to stabilize and elevate the Pharos, and, even then, I'd be a little nervous. I'm not looking to use any official grinding/milling attachments from Kenwood—partly because of cost, but mostly because it would be less fun :)  


Any and all thoughts and input welcome. Grinder recommendations esp. welcome!

Does this not happen to anyone else? Is my only solution to do a thorough clean of my grinder each time I use it? I don't understand.. I live in a temperate climate (the Midwest).",somedudeman35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1448rus/how_to_prevent_big_clumps_of_grinds_getting_stuck/

* have lived in Brooklyn/Manhattan the last 10 years, so have been spoiled with the availability of great beans, baristas, and coffee shops

Mellita Calibre burr grinder

I have been unable to get a decent cup of coffee since i bought the MM, have tried multiple speciality coffees and every possible grind size to no avail, the cup always tasted sour or sharp and not in a good way. I genuinely couldn't understand how everyone says how good these machines are until one afternoon in my aunts when she made me a cup of pre-ground Lavazza and it tasted great.

After buying some Aldi pre-ground house blend (the cheapest coffee available in my region) this tasted quite nice, I immediately realised its nothing to do with the MM and the sole issue was my Melitta grinder, i suspect this is a result of the Melitta producing too many fines wich are then overextracted at the bottom of the filter.

As a coffee newb i always thought fresh beans with a burr grinder are always better than pre-ground, however grind consistency and low fines seems to be quite a lot more important when just looking for a good cup of coffee.

Now I cant wait to try some speciality that have been pre-ground properly. What kind of grind should  request?

Most roasters around me offer these options:

Course - French Press

Medium - pour over

Medium fine - AeroPress",Inevitable_Loss5739,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/143cp4f/was_just_about_to_give_up_on_the_moccamaster/

142gsuf,"De'Longhi super auto's, do they just suck?",1,15,,"Hello r/Coffee! I purchased a De'Longhi Magnificia Evo a few days ago. Coming from a Nespresso machine I was excited to drink some better coffee while still having the convenience. Sadly though the coffee is not what I expected nor is the espresso. I know you've seen a lot of these threads and it's bit of a read so please bear with me.

I have Ethiopian single origin beans from a local roaster (roasted 20th of may) and a dark roast from the supermarket but the Nespresso with cheap supermarket cups pretty much tastes better than both. I have drank dark roasted supermarket coffee from a different automatic before and it was amazing coming from Nespresso. 

The single origin coffee came out pretty sour in the beginning but also somehow bitter as if it contains way too much caffeine? You know when the bitterness lingers in the back of the throat for a very long time.

First thing I did was adjust the grinder to grind finer, this took away some of the sourness but the bitterness still remained, it didn't even get that much more bitter, just still very bad. Crazy thing is: The darker roasted beans from the supermarket are almost exactly as bitter as the single origin Ethiopia! They also taste extremely similar on my machine and are both pretty weak. 

So I have played with:
- All temperature settings, lower temperature makes the coffee a bit more sour and weak but not really less bitter. (It does feel like the coffee temp doesn't actually change that much though.)
- Grind size: finer grind does actually make the coffee more bitter and also makes it less sour. Making the grind extremely course makes the coffee extremely sour but STILL very bitter also.
- Coffee strength: just makes the coffee less or more strong as expected.

Summarized (TL;DR): single origin coffee from local roaster tastes almost like dark roast from supermarket but just more sour (and a bit more flavour I guess), coffee stays very bitter whatever you set the machine to but the acidity does change greatly. The temperature adjustment seems to not do alot. 

I have a feeling the machine extracts way too much caffeine or something? Is the machine just broken and if so what do you think is the issue, are De'Longhi automatics just not very good or is there something I'm missing here?

The issue is that I have never been in the vicinity of competitive latte art before, and I'm definitely no coffee nerd. I've tried googling to find information, and so far the general criteria that I've seen website mention have been a combination of the following:

* Balance/symmetry
* Harmony/positioning/use of space
* Clarity of design
* Quality of milk texture
* Creativity/originality
* Overall appeal/impression
* Aesthetic beauty
* Difficulty
* (There's no mentions of flavor, is that not something we judge?)

I am therefore asking you guys if you have any tips, general guidelines or pointers towards good resources that I can use. The event is tomorrow, and right now I'm mostly worried about how to sleep after drinking coffee until 10 pm, so I am kinda lost.

1406gf8,Rinsing filter paper: why does it taste better when not rinsed?,67,84,,"I’m new to the coffee party and have been brewing my cups in a V60 Mugen for the past few days. On the first try, I completely skipped the part of rinsing coffee paper and brewed a really, really tasty cup. Granted, I also used a Hoffman V60 method instead of the Mugen one. It resulted in the whole process taking around 7-8 minutes. 

I make sure to rinse the paper now, and follow Tetsu Kasuya’s method. The cups I am producing (I am drinking one now), are good as well, but that very first cup seemed to have a little more pronounced taste. It had this kind of pleasant bitterness to it, as well. My current cups have that bitterness, but which is a tad bit less pleasant. 

My first thought was the paper filter, now, I am thinking maybe it is the technique? Could it also be my coffee? I do not have a good grinder at home, for now, so I asked my local roaster to grind coffee for me. It is now 4 days old.

Last year I bought the Fellow Stagg EKG kettle for my pour overs. The kettle is really fine but after a few month, the very slow flow rate started to be very frustrating, not only for noodles and food in general but mostly for my pour overs (since I want a high flow/high agitation pour).

Once I stumbled across a video on YouTube (that I can’t find anymore) where some people had a modified kettle and since then, i’ve been wondering if I can in fact modify my kettle to have a better flow rate.

The ideal flow for me would be the brewista artisan’s one, but I don’t have the money to throw my Fellow away and buy one.

I suppose I could sand the end of the spout to have a faster flow rate but my question is : is the flow-restricting part at the base of the spout or at the end ?

I'm taking on some barista shadowing/shifts behind the bar for the first time ever this week in prep for moving to Australia and hopefully doing it full-time in the Autumn (Australian Spring). My current job is office work, so very different.

I'm finding it overwhelming learning about the different coffee drinks and methods, and quirks of each coffeeshop, so I wanted to know: **what's your best advice for a new barista?**

I did the SCA Barista Skills Foundation last month, which helped loads with theory and a bit with method, but I know doing it for customers is a whole different beast.

13xrduj,How to prepare for an AeroPress Championship,377,56,,"I’m a regional AeroPress 2nd place holder (losing against the three time current regional champion), and lost in the first round against our current national AeroPress champion in the national championship. When I’ve spoken about my experience it had some interest, so I thought it might be a good thing to write a little summary of my findings.

An AeroPress Championship is a competition in which you brew a coffee with an AeroPress, normally at the same time as two other competitors, which then normally three judges taste, without communicating with each other, and then choose the best-tasting one, by pointing to the winning cup. The name of the contestant is written under the cup, and switched places before the judges taste them, so there should be no way of knowing who’s cup is which.

There are three rules that must be observed:

You can’t use more than 18 grams of ground coffee.
You must present a coffee of at least 150ml.
You have to brew and present it within 5 minutes.
You can grind and heat your water before the timer starts. The beans for the competition will normally be ones from the organizers or sponsors of the competitions. They are the same for everyone. They will be made available for the participants 10 days before the competition, either for pick-up or by sending them to you. You’ll get one bag of 250 grams of beans, and another bag of the same size the day of the competition.

In those 10 days, you can experiment with the beans all you want. Keep in mind that if you use 18 grams of beans each time, you can only brew 13 cups, so be mindful of how you use the beans.

For me, the best strategy was first picking up a well-renowned good water for coffee in my country. You can try different waters and do a cupping first if you really want to nail the water first, but it takes a lot of effort (you have to brew each water independently), and I don’t think you get much out of it in the beginning.

From there use a well-known to you recipe that you normally use for the AeroPress. For me, it was the James Hoffman Method:

12g beans
200ml water
100º C water
2:00 shake, 2:30-3:00 press.
Now you have a baseline for what it tastes like, and you can experiment. The good thing is that all variables are defined and there is somewhat of a golden zone.

Water: You should look for a well-renowned water for being good for coffee in your country. Other than that, I know that Calcium, Magnesium, and alcalinity are important for coffee extraction, but not enough to tell you the exact proportions, sorry. You can go as deep on this as want. You can use a Britta or BWT Filter, you can buy water packets from specialty coffee vendors, or you can create your own with distilled water, and then calculate the quantities of sodium bicarbonate and magnesium sulfate you need to add to get the quality in the water that you want. This will give you very marginal gains in terms of taste, much much less than having a good recipe, so I’d say that unless you know what you are doing, at most buy a few easily available and well regarded waters, and with your recipe determined, try which one tastes best.

Temperature: Most recipes recommend brewing between 80º C to 100ºC, so try 3 brews changing only temperature, 90ºC, 80ºC, and 100ºC. I recommend trying with 90ºC first because it is more likely to being close to optimal, so you’ll have a decent reference to start from. The generally accepted wisdom is that darker roasted coffee is preferably brewed at a lower temperature, and lighter roasts at almost boiling temperatures. I’d say lately the lighter roasts being better at boiling points affirmation has been more in contention, especially with experimental fermentation coffee. In any case, taste is king.

Brew time: Most recipes start from at least 1 minute. Since you have a 5-minute time limit to make and serve the coffee, I would recommend not brewing more than for 4 minutes. Keep in mind that you’ll also have to prepare the AeroPress, pour the water, and cool down the coffee in that time. Technically the longer you brew it, the sweeter the coffee will be, but extraction can be sped up with stirring. Stirring is less likely to be consistent brew to brew so be wary of that, since you’ll be going round through round with the same recipe, and its a good thing to be consistent.

Grind size: Start with the grind size recommended for the AeroPress for your grinder, and go finer until you notice astringency (it dries out your mouth) and go one step coarser. That’ll be the perfect grind setting for you. They’ll most likely offer you a few different grinders during the competitions, but if you don’t know the perfect setting for your recipe on that grinder I would refrain from using them, even if they are much more sophisticated, because it’ll most likely produce different effects on your recipe. It has been said that grinding twice, first very coarse and then those ground beans to the final desired size may be beneficial, as it may be a way to reduce ultrafines and create a more even grind, and the current AeroPress World Champion has certainly done so, but I do not think that she won solely because of that.

Proportions of coffee and water: This is a difficult one. The AeroPress can hold at most about 300ml, and that would be pushing it. If you brew normally some of that will bypass the coffee without actually extracting much, which will the reduce the strength of the coffee compared to using the inverted method. This is not necessarily a bad thing just something to account for when trying recipes. Since you can use only 18g or less and the AeroPress can only hold about 300ml you have two upper limits here, which coincidentally makes for a somewhat golden zone ratio, as that would be 1 part of beans to 16 parts of water (also normally expressed as 1:16) You can manipulate it by using more water after brewing but it is a good reference to have. I’ve seen people go as low as 1:20 and as strong as 1:10. So that would be 10 grams and 20 grams of ground beans for 200ml of water, respectively. It has been said that bland coffees benefit from using stronger ratios, and flowery and experimentally processed coffees from milder concentrations to let the smells and taste develop, but I’d say it is very bean specific. Just determine it according to your own taste.

Filters: According to the official rules you can use any kind of filter as long as you use the normal filter cap from the AeroPress itself. You can use official paper filters from AeroPress itself, the fairly recently produced official metal Aeropress filter, or a cloth one if you want. I’ve also seen competitors using two paper filters at the same time, and Aesir filters, which are a premium type of filter said to provide more clarity.

Other considerations: Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that the judges will taste the coffee short after brewing it, so if it is still hot, it will not be judged favorably. I have an external thermometer so I’ve determined that the optimal serving temperature for me was 65ºC, which I managed to reach quickly by switching the coffee from mug to mug a few times to get it to cool down quickly, because the heat of the coffee will dissipate in the cold mug. Optimal drinking temperature has been said to be 60ºC, so I keep it a little higher because I don’t know how long the judges will take to cup the brewed coffee. Keep in mind that the judges will base their judgments of your coffee by sipping the coffee (loudly) from a spoon, much like cupping, so the whole brew won’t be judged as such, just those sips. Make sure you optimize taste for this, then.

While calibrating your recipe keep in mind to only change one variable at a time, and in order to do comparative tasting I would actually recommend using more than one AeroPress if you can to keep the brewed coffee temperatures similar at the same time.

On the day of the competition I’ve seen people spread out their beans to filter out defect beans which can improve flavor. I’ve also seen the Kruve and other sifters being used to filter out the ultrafines after grinding, as they have a tendency to overextract and taste bitter. If you have it and want to use it do so by all means, but otherwise I wouldn’t even entertain the thought.

Final thoughts: I would like to clearly state that I only wrote this out to put a method to my own process of optimizing a recipe for a specific bean as a learning process, and that the most important part of participating in an AeroPress competition is having fun, getting to know other people that have the same passion as you, make new friends and grow as a person. At the end of the day, you can think you have the best recipe ever, but if it is not according to the tastes of the judges there is nothing you can do, so relax and have fun. You are likely to see people who have been years in the industry with very expensive tools, but don’t let that intimidate you, because in my experience they are as likely to win as the newcomers if their recipe is more according to the tastes of the judges. Everybody there will share the same passion as you for the beverage, so take the opportunity to make some friends in the industry.

I hope this text gives you a little bit of direction in the search for the perfect AeroPress recipe! Also, feedback is extremely welcome!",AirlineEasy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/13xrduj/how_to_prepare_for_an_aeropress_championship/

13xft50,Channeling every time,37,36,,"Hey, I have a Breville Bambino Plus machine for espresso and De'Longhi KG 89 grinder.   
Each time I make myself a double espresso with a bottomless portafilter, I get channeling. 

My process of making the espresso:

1. put 19g of coffee into the 20g basket (non-pressurized)
2. use the WDT tool to evenly distribute the coffee
3. tamp it with a non-measured amount of strength
4. put an ""espresso puck screen"" (metal mesh ring) on top of the coffee
5. put the portafilter into the machine and go

Before using the puck screen, I was putting 20-21g of coffee into the basket, it was yielding a very similar result - some channeling. If I put less ground coffee / no screen, there's more channeling.

What am I doing wrong? The way I dialed in the grind size was to grind so fine that the coffee wouldn't come out of the espresso machine (just a few droplets of coffee), then increase the grind size by one step till the coffee pours normally.

The other issue I am experiencing is if I make the coffee with the exact same settings, but use the basket for a single espresso (\~10g of ground coffee), the flow of coffee is very slow.

My guess is the grinder doesn't grind the coffee beans evenly, but I'm not sure. Would too small or too big of pressure during tamping affect the flow like channeling?

Interestingly, this issue mostly occurs when I use medium-roasted coffee. With dark roasts, there is way less channeling, but still occurs.",sloniu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/13xft50/channeling_every_time/

13whuj1,Water hardness is more important than I thought,200,103,,"This topic is being discussed here often. But I still wasn't aware how important it is. So I just wanted to throw a piece of my experience into the bag.

My home tap water is rather soft (45 KH, 90 GH), so I thought that it should be good for coffee. It doesn't taste good because of some other contaminants, but tastes great after filtering it with a filter jug, which - besides removing bad taste - drops the hardness rather heavily (25 KH, 50 GH). For a long time I thought that's okay and I got used to my coffee tasting rather flat (I'm new to coffee drinking so I didn't really have a reference to compare it to). Actually the best cups I got with V60 were the ones with brew time reaching 4-5 minutes, but not consistently, as with such a long drawdown usually astringency took over the taste. Only sporadically it tasted very good.

In my mind, I set the blame to many things - probably coffee beans are not really good, my grinder (C2) produces too many fines etc. but it didn't cross my mind that water might just be *too* soft. I knew that too hard water is a big problem, but I haven't thought the other way.

Recently, for convenience, I decided to switch from jug filter, to 3-way tap and a filter under sink. The new filter system has a simple adjustment of water softening (switch with 4 positions). I set it up according to my water hardness. The filtered water is now around 35-40 KH and 70-80 GH while still tasting great.

I have brewed a few cups with this water already and the difference is unbelievable. I get results full of flavor, very pleasant acidity and sweetnes and no astringency, every time. Of course that's only in comparison to my previous brews, but still I would have never thought that increasing water hardness slightly would be so impactful.",RudyHuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/13whuj1/water_hardness_is_more_important_than_i_thought/
13wo40l,French Press vs Aeropress: what is better for the first time user?,32,82,,"I started drinking black coffee and want to up my game. I’ve been using Bosch automatic grinder I happened to find at home and a tea infuser to brew cups. I also dried pre-packaged (grind) coffee in special filters you put on a cup and the brew them. 

I’m trying to dive in into the world of coffee a bit deeper, hence thinking of upgrading my gear a bit, instead of using a tea infuser… I knew of French Presses and I quite like the idea, but have recently found out about Aeropress and am considering it as well. 

In terms of personal preference, I should mention that I usually drink one cup of coffee in the morning, occasionally two if I have a taste for it. I cannot drink Espresso due to its bitterness, hence I guess I prefer less bitter coffee, at least for now. 

 Cheers!

UPDATE: It turned out, the coffee from V60 tasted the best to me! I really liked the lack of sediment and the taste was so good! The barista was exceptionally nice and explained everything to me, showed me how different methods work. Aeropress looked slightly complicated, and not particularly enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing. Then, the French Press. It was my choice when I went out into the city, I thought it’d be best method for now. 

I did consult with the barista, and he did suggest a V60 as a first-time brewing method and made us both a cup. I have never tasted a better coffee. I have not tried much, of course, and my black coffee journey were the taste actually matters started two weeks ago. I did understand what the “clean” taste was that people were talking about. It had such a pronounced and intense taste, without any bitterness. It was almost tea-like. Velvety and creamy in texture. Lack of sediment was very nice as well. I did not mind it in my “tea infuser brew” (forgive me), but not having it was exceptional. I decided to buy the V60 right away. It seemed most accessible, pleasant and tasty way. I also got a small Hario server which is perfect for single person. It fits 300 ml.

I noticed a definitive improvement over the Encore I used to have, but recently I visited a coffee festival where I had a chance to taste and buy so much of different coffee. After buying it, it just doesn't taste not even half as good as there.

I always have this lingering dryness in the after taste and I can't seem to get rid of it in any way. I'm brewing James Hoffmann's single cup recipe, to the point, using 93C soft bottled water.

I took pictures of samples of grind sizes 1,3,5,7 and 9. They look okay at the first glance, but you can see there is a lot of fines in every setting, I think that might be the cause? I also took a picture of a bed after a 3:15 brew, on setting 5. Should be juicy, but I'm getting a lot of dry finish and muddy flavors.

Do these grounds look okay?

EDIT: Thanks everyone, looks like there really was something strange going on with the grinder. I took the whole thing apart and decided to align the burrs to get clean wipe on both. Took some time, but the difference is absolutely there! There is much less heavy body now with more clarity and fruity juiciness. You can also quite clearly see the difference in grounds themselves! It now grinds a bit finer overall, or it might just be the absense of boulders. Much more consistent overall.

13u5ggb,Honduran farmer coffee roast: does it have a name?,95,16,,"I visited Honduras several times to see my cousin, a missionary priest. We would travel to little mountain villages, and he’d give mass, etc. 

Almost every farmer there had a roasting table. I was told that they would sell the good beans and do a special campesino (farmer) roast with the bad beans. 

They would layout the bad beans with bad sugar cane and roast them together. The result was a soupy, sugary, thick cup of sludge that I learned to love. I’m not suggesting it was technically good at all. 

Does it have a name? Is it a thing outside poor farming villages?

If anyone is interested, here’s an extra tidbit about it: I was in a mountain village that we literally road burros two hours to get to. I stopped sweating at the hottest part of the day and got cold (not good.) A man noticed and quickly brought me a boiling cup of the sludge. 

I tried to refuse, but he insisted and my cousin told me to drink it. Two sips in, my entire body exploded in sweat.

13uc38h,How much does grinder capacity matter to you?,26,30,," 

I'm looking to get my first ""good"" grinder at the moment and I ordered the C3. I realized after getting it that the max capacity is 20, maybe 25 grams.  I'd say 90% of the time I do 23-25 grams. Otherwise, I occasionally do a bigger batch (usually for myself but sometimes for others). With that in mind, I'm concerned that it might not be enough in the future in case I want to grind more at once. So I'm wondering: how much does capacity actually matter to you? Is it worth getting a bigger grinder to avoid having to refill and grind multiple times? What do you think I should do?",PresidentPain,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/13uc38h/how_much_does_grinder_capacity_matter_to_you/
13urh1s,Trouble dialing in 40g doses with C40 and Hario Switch. Any suggestions?,2,13,,"Hi everyone,

I am a proud owner of a C40 for almost 4 years now and a Hario Switch 03 and Hario Kettle for a year. Also I am using the Rao/Perger Water recipe from CoffeeAdAstra for a couple of weeks. Since I changed my water from filter water to this recipe I noticed a huge change in coffee taste. It just tested better. And here is the BUT.But since that change I am aiming more and more towards to proclaimed taste profiles of the roasters and more consistency with daily brews, which I mostly fail. I am mostly brewing light roasts from Peru, Ethiopia, Kenya (Holm Kaffee, Schön Kaffee or Coffee Circle).

Most of these recipes suggest 20g doses, with 25-27 clicks on the C40 and standard V60 setup and temps around 94-95°C. I already struggle with these recipes, since I never land in the sweet spot of 3:30-4 min drawdown time (coffee bed looks flat and fine though). The Coffee tastes good most of the time. But there has to be some potential I am missing.

Once I start to scale things up the brew larger volumes I really struggle. I have to go up to 36 sometimes 40 clicks to achieve acceptable times 4:30 up to 6:00. Sometimes the coffee tastes to watery, sometimes a still a little bitter and I never achieve the taste profile like with the smaller dose. It is always a good cup of coffee, don't get me wrong. I am just trying to be more consistent in my brews.

I use the Hario V02 paper and mostly the Katsuo Tetsuya 4:6 recipe38g coffee - 120g 160g 120g 120g 120g - 1:16,84 ratio

So I am looking for some advice, maybe for my setup to brew larger doses.  


Update: I am trying(!) to use the Hario Switch as a classic V60 Pourer for larger doses. I know this is an immersion brewer and I've had stellar results that way. But also only for smaller to medium doses up to 30g coffee and max 480ml water. My goal is to find a recipe for 40g of coffee around 1:15-1:17 for light roasts for the Hario Switch 03.",h0nki,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/13urh1s/trouble_dialing_in_40g_doses_with_c40_and_hario/

13tv8ce,Best practice for hitting the right temperature (french press)?,32,30,,"I tried finding the best temperature and method for my french press coffee. But it's not so easy.

(1) Previously, I would just pour boiling water (\~98°C) into the cold french press, which results in \~89°. Thus the coffee got a temperature spike at 98°, but then brewed in rather cold water of 89°. It worked for my other coffee, but I now got a new coffee and it doesn't taste well anymore.

(2) I then tried this: Pouring boiling water into a milk pitcher and measuring the temperature. At around 91°-93° (various tests), I poured it into the cold french press, which results in \~87°. So same as before, but colder: the coffee gets a peak temp of e.g. 91° but then brews in 87°C.

For those tests, I always brewed 2 min with breaking the crust at around 1.5 min and ""pushing down"" at 2 min. The cup is preheated of course.

(3) Now I tried: Pour the boiling water into the empty french press. First round results in a low temperature as well. But pouring the water out immediately (for heating the cup) and pouring fresh hot water in the empty french press again, results in \~95°. So I can just measure and wait, until the temperature is just right. Today, I put the coffee ground at 92.5° into the french press. It tasted alright, but somewhat ""watery"", despite I had the exact amount of coffee ground and waters as before.

It seems like I get the ""best"" result with the third method. But that's totally different from what is told on the internet. Also, I am not happy either. It's complicated and the coffee tastes watery.

As a future test, maybe a little bit off topic, I would like to prepare some ""espresso"" coffee in my french press. Idk, is this just darker roast? I got this for testing, but preparing it as normal just tastes really bitter. But I know this roast, it tastes really great when I tasted it from the espresso machine at the roastery. I assume that with the right temperature, I can make it at least drinkable.

Conclusion and questions:

I am wondering, if the coffee actually might need a temperature spike at e.g. 95°?

Does the coffee should sit in e.g. 92°C or should that be the spike and it should rather sit in 88°C?

13t6ntz,My Eugenioides review,57,32,self,"I was lucky enough to have a local roaster who was able to secure a bid of the Eugenioides shipment. I paid about $36 for 20 grams worth of beans. I intentionally waited a week before brewing just to make sure I had every detail dialed in before I opened the pack, which came in a very nice air tight plastic bottle encased in a cylindrical light proof covering.

After a lot of thinking, I decided on a 1:13 ratio using the Tetsu Kasuya's V60 technique vs the Switch God (or Demon) technique, with a 40 gram bloom and a 60 gram ""2nd bloom"" that ended at 1:30. From there, I poured out 50 grams and waited till near complete drainage to begin my subsequent pours, stopping at 260 grams and near the 2:45 mark. Water was 92C, and loss of temperature due to decreasing mass was minimal. A plastic V60 was used, along with original Hario paper. Grind size was honestly what I regularly use for all my V60 usage, as I have another grinder for my Chemex. I would say the setting is on the finer size of what is typically recommended for a 1zpresso JX.

Good news and bad news (actually more good news): I feel like I brewed this coffee as good as it can be brewed. Obviously, I have no other point of reference to other Eugenioides coffees, but I'm pretty confident in my ability to make pour overs given my experience.

As for the taste, it was very, very pleasantly....neutral. Not strong, but nice and light and pleasant but not in a FOMO inducing sort of way. As for aftertaste, I can't say I noticed any particular aftertaste like I can with other coffees, and not even a hint so I'm confident I didn't just brew it incorrectly. I can say that at this price point, I strongly advise most people to just wait a few years until the price falls as more get's produced (if that happens). Or, at least pay much less than I did. Honestly, it's nothing amazing. But, if this were widely/readily available as a coffee option, I would probably drink this every morning, or maybe after work so the caffeine wouldn't affect my sleep.

Hope this helps anyone about to brew or just curious.

edit: I wrote this within 30 minutes of drinking. It may be the chocolate I was enjoying with this cup, but there may be a very slight...lemony aftertaste?

&#x200B;

edit2: I see a lot of people describing coffees as ""\[insert fruit\] bombs"" etc. I personally don't have that strong of a sense of taste. I have a deviated septum, I was a pack-a-day (or worse) smoker for 16 years, and maybe I can't taste such things, but in my experience I've never tasted these types of things from coffee. At best, I taste some fruitiness, maybe stonefruits, citrus, etc. I think I'm pretty good at tasting burgers, french fries, and I love spicy stuff. So, make of that info what you will.

edit3: For some reason some people find it hard to believe I paid that much. I don't really need to prove anything to anyone, [but whatever](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:IHqiTpZrXKQJ:https://48e.co/&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=kw).

13scfaj,Brew temp: the untold story,94,79,,"In recipes, and general discussions, people can be very precise about the brew temp -- ""you're brewing at 204, you should try 206"". But I don't often see people talk about the temp of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th pour. Obviously the water cools, and the rate of cooling varies quite a bit depending on the heating vessel and the amount of water in it. For example, today I heated 370mL of water to 208 and my 4th pour was 180. (I acknowledge there are some recipes that precisely specify multiple brew temps in stages, but I'm not talking about those recipes.)

So my question for discussion is this -- do you think the later water temperatures matter as much as the first? Do you actively monitor or try to maintain certain temperatures?

Personally, I have not conducted any experiments, or really made enough casual observations to have an opinion here. But I do think about it from time to time!

As the title suggests I have a Barista Express and I can get ok expresso out of it but the shots always come out rather quickly (15 seconds) unless I choke the machine by tamping too hard, grinding too small or have combo of both.

If I try to increase the shot time length/volume by using the program button and then hitting the double button, while it's extractong it doesn't let me go any longer than what I'm getting and just stops the shot. Must think it's already extracted the max amount.
I'm normally getting about 60g out of 19g coffee in 17 seconds.

13r9req,[Clever Dripper] Does it make sense that it drains really fast if I let it steep for longer?,13,17,,"I often use my Clever Dripper to make about 400ml of coffee (in). I tend to grind at a filter setting. Close to where I would grind for a V60 actually. Because I'm usually not in a rush, I let it steep for a couple of minutes (4-6) and then let it drain. It drains reeeally fast, in like 10-15 seconds. This is weird because I pretty much follow James Hoffman's recipe and the grind is not particularly coarse, as it is at most 1-2 clicks coarser (Fellow Ode with SSPs) than a cone cup V60 setting, so I'm surprised by the short drain time. I would expect something more like 40 seconds (I'm doing water first if anyone's interested). I'm using white Filtropa filters.

I have two theories:

1) It drains faster when it has extracted more (I'm not draining at 2 minutes like Hoffmann, but rather at 5-6).

2) I'm grinding too fine and there are channels through which the water runs very quickly.

13qhh4w,Question on Filter Pitchers,54,21,,"Recently got an espresso machine and I’ve been looking into a more economical way of processing water for the machine (currently using bottles Volvic to tide me over)

I don’t have space under my sink for a built in system, and I don’t have the budget for RO etc.

Looking for recommendations on filter pitchers that get rid of chlorine and impurities while adding Magnesium.

I live in Ireland and the water ranges from 80ppm to 220ppm.

Conscious that with the variables it’s never going to be perfect until I get into other methods but for now I want to go down the pitcher route and it would be great if there’s any suggestions out there.

13nfw64,"""Fellow Stagg won't heat up"" - thermal fuse replacement guide",267,22,self,"Recently I had a friend give me a Fellow Stagg which suddenly quit working on him - as a fun side project I took a shot at repairing it. The kettle would power on and read temperature correctly but it wouldn't heat up and would eventually go to sleep. I haven't seen any threads of videos discussing this issue so I figured I'd make a write up explaining how to fix the problem I encountered because it seems like it could be a pretty common issue. Another good thread to look at if you're having issues is [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/uo5pyq/repairing_pastwarranty_fellow_stagg_ekg/).

- **What broke:**

Basically what killed this kettle was a blown thermal fuse in the base of the kettle. [You can see it disconnected from the circuit here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/513642351554461698/1109647994460045332/20230517_193040.jpg), for some reason Fellow decided to put a fuse that they don't tell the user about under a cover which uses tamper-proof screws. I've heard they're kinda iffy on right to repair so this doesn't surprise me.

- **Access + Inspection**

Underneath the bottom of the kettle there are 3 tamper-proof triangle screws that need to be removed. I didn't have a triangle bit but I was able to get a 4mm allen head into the head of the screw; it's a bit tricky to get it to grab but once it does the screw comes out pretty easy, these are basically just hand tight plus a little extra torque.

After that once you have the base removed you're going to want to get a multimeter out and start checking continuity. For those unfamiliar with checking continuity [this is a good resource](https://www.fluke.com/en-us/learn/blog/digital-multimeters/how-to-test-for-continuity). The fuse is in the red wire, covered a piece of white insulation. Unfortunately I forgot to take a picture before I removed the fuse but you're going to want to check between [points 1 and 2 in this image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/452699771526840324/1109659995580145664/image.png), if the wire is open then you're fuse is blown, if you've got continuity then your issue is somewhere else. 

- **How to repair**

Luckily if your fuse is blown this is a pretty easy repair to make. The fuses specs are *185c, 250v, 10a*. I got a generic off of Amazon but you can source them from pretty much anywhere. You're also going to want to get some crimp connectors (approximately 16-22awg size) and a crimp tool if you don't have one (you can make pliers work though). **Do not solder thermal fuses**. Your soldering iron is more than hot enough to trip the new fuse! I nearly did until I caught myself lol.

Start by using a razor blade or a knife to remove the white heat shrink around the fuse. After you've got that off go ahead and cut the fuse off of the wire where it connects. Then you'll want to get your new fuse ready. I started by trimming the ends of my fuse short enough where my crimp connectors covered the exposed wire on the fuse then crimped the fuse side of the crimp connector. That way both crimp connecters were installed and tight on the fuse so they're ready to go before I installed it on the wire but you can do it pretty much however you want. 

Once you're ready to strip the wire to install the new fuse you'll want to use your razor blade to trim back the read insulation around the the wire to expose the insulation underneath. Then remove about .2"" of insulation and crimp both sides wire into the fuse. After that reinstall the terminal and check for continuity. If you've got continuity you're good to go. [Here's what mine looked like when I was done](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/513642351554461698/1109647994808188928/20230520_193327.jpg), a bit sloppy but it worked out. 

After that simply button everything back up and try it out. When I reinstalled my screws I went and [cut a slot in the head](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/513642351554461698/1109647995143721101/20230520_195326.jpg) using a die grinder - an angle grinder, dremel or anything that can mount a cutoff wheel will work (or even a hacksaw if you've got patience). Or you can replace them with Phillips heads if you've got screws that fit. 

As an aside; should you want to open up the base of the kettle if this wasn't your issue there are 4 screws hidden under the sicker at the base of the kettle. Peel the sticker off then it's the same deal as the kettle screws though for these a 3mm Allen head worked better. After the screws are out you'll want to use a thin flathead or a plastic trim tool to pry between the two halves of the base and pull it down. Be gentle and work your way around the base. 


Hopefully this was helpful for anyone searching for this issue. It seems very bizarre to me to use a fuse in a non-serviceable part of the appliance instead of something resettable, especially on a $100 kettle. My only other experience with repairing coffee appliances has been Baratza and it was a lot better than Fellow.",Tsao_Aubbes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/13nfw64/fellow_stagg_wont_heat_up_thermal_fuse/
13n0qa6,Why not toss bloom water?,145,104,self,"I've read a [reasonable](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-hows-and-whys-of-blooming-coffee) [amount](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpKEdZjpqXM) of [the thinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/2ehsqp/the_science_behind_blooming/) on blooming and it seems plausible and reasonable to me.

Blooming helps the rest of the water extract properly and gets rid of acidic carbon dioxide. What is surprising is that almost nobody recommends the obvious next step: Toss the bloom water before starting to prepare your coffee. It's thin, cold and acidic, why do you want to dilute your coffee with it! This idea has been discussed here (2015 is 8 years ago?!) [once before](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/2r96ww/pour_out_the_bloom_coffee/) with very few conclusions.

I've only done it once or twice and cannot taste the difference, but I'd love to hear your thoughts.

Edit:

[Vernicious](https://www.reddit.com/user/Vernicious/) nails it. That cold thin acidic water [contains \~40% of the caffeine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=347&v=etnMr8oUSDo&feature=youtu.be) you will ever extract.

From what i understand, espresso is basically coffee that has a high concentration due to low quantity of water, fine grind aided by pressure to achieve that. 

However, let's assume a normal espresso extracted X% of the coffee beans.

Why, in theory, could i not just get the same low quantity of water and infuse in a French Press to the same level of X% extraction? I.e., neither over nor under extracted
If the grind needs to be finer for the same level of extraction, grind finer.
If the temperature cools off to quickly due to the low thermal mass, keep the solution heated during the infusion. 
Keep stiring if helps the extraction.

13ixccp,Indonesian Coffee taste profile.,94,55,,"I've been trying multiple beans from Indonesia and they don't really match the stereotype of ""bitter, nutty,  earthy, and thick bodied"" taste profile most people associate them with on the internet. Most people who like bitter coffee tend to drink robustas brewed with local method ""Tubruk"", but the arabica specialty market is completely different. They also have Starbucks-esque drink like Kopi Susu Gula Aren (iced latte with palm sugar) but that's not what I'm going to talk about here.

There is a huge variety of beans from Aceh Gayo, Halu Highlands, Bali Kintamani, Papua, etc so it doesn't do them justice to make a generalisation, but their flavour tends to be complex with high acidity and sweetness. Most ""filter roasts"" are light-medium roast as the default. Washed beans are uncommon; anaerobic natural, honey, and carbonic maceration seem to be the most common processing methods at specialty roasters. Ethiophian Yirgacheffe tastes pretty mild compared to most Indonesian coffees.

There are a lot more filter coffee drinkers (mostly V60s) compared to espresso-centric places like Melbourne. The current coffee culture there seems to be influenced by Tokyo and Melbourne coffee scene with local twist.

If you haven't tried Indonesian coffee for a long time, I encouraged you to do it as it has evolved quite dramatically in the last few years.",callizer,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/13ixccp/indonesian_coffee_taste_profile/

I've been pondering whether lactic acidity in coffee has a positive or negative effect.

13j8ve4,Aeropress flow control cap tearing paper filters,0,35,self,"Hi all, I recently purchased one of the new Aeropress flow control caps (https://aeropress.com/products/aeropress-flow-control-filter-cap). For the most part, I'm happy with my purchase. It's a nice quality of life improvement not having to quickly insert the plunger to make an airtight seal (from the Hoffmann method). And, I've noticed it produces a slightly stronger tasting cup as a result (perhaps because there is zero drip-through during the brew).

However, I have noticed it is tearing my paper filters way faster than the original cap. Usually, I could reuse a paper filter 5 times before replacing it. But with this new cap, I'm seeing tears in the paper after 2-3 uses. I'm kind of confused because they claim the new caps are compatible with the paper filters. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this?

Edit: I thought it was normal to reuse paper filters, but I guess it isn't. Lesson learned, I'll start using fresh filters for each brew.",VariableFlame,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/13j8ve4/aeropress_flow_control_cap_tearing_paper_filters/

13hjhmw,Help Cloning Lotus Water Drops,10,19,,"Greetings fellow coffee heads,

I'm looking into cloning Lotus Water Drops because I already have all the food grade chemicals. I use the chemicals for when I'm brewing beer and cloning mineral water to have on tap. I use [Martin Lersch's mineral water calculator](http://blog.khymos.org/2012/01/04/mineral-waters-a-la-carte/) for both of those processes. That spreadsheet has the SCAA target water recipe built into the excel file. I use that one currently for pour overs (I'm too afraid to add any extra chemicals to my espresso machine other than my very neutral filtered tap water).

I want to diversify into other water recipes and Lotus Water Drops look like the smartest way to conduct coffee water chemistry experiments (especially conducting the experiment that Scott Rao advises in [this blog post](https://www.scottrao.com/blog/lotus-water-drops)). I can't stand the thought of paying $50 for a few ounces of dosed distilled water, so I want to mix up my own dropper bottles of Calcium Chloride (CaCl2), Magnesium Chloride (MgCl2), Sodium Bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and Potassium Bicarbonate (KHCO3).

1) Might it be astringency, or had it never felt any dryness would there be other possible/potential factors?

3) What would the factors be? What if all/most of them are water-soluble large molecules, how much does brewing method matter?
