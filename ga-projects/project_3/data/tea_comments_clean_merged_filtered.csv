19a96f2,kijcmym,"Brewed Gong Fu style. 5 g tea to 50ish ml water at 212 F. Gaiwan, cha hai, cup warmed. Tea steamed. 5 seconds, 10 s, 15 s, 20 s, 25 s, 30 s, 35 s, 40 s, 45 s, 50 s, 55 s, 1 minute, 1.5 m, 2 m, 3 m, 5 m, 10 m

Steamed leaves had aromas of plums, citrus, and chocolate.

Wow. This tea was stellar from the start.

Apricot finish with sweetness. Check.
Lovely nose with fruit and florality. Check.
Complex enjoyable palate. Check.
Silky mouthfeel with astringency. Check.

Aroma of cherries in empty cup.

Charcoal note on palate arrived and went away during session. Just the processing of the tea stopping by briefly to say hi.

Finish was very silky by 9th infusion.

Longevity: Check!

Minerality crept into nose on 12th infusion.

Great evolution: Check!

Finish became more like nice ripely sweet peaches near end of session.

By end of session, finish was fairly thick on back of tongue.
At just over $.50 per gram ($.53 if you buy 4 ounce bag), this tea is an incredible value. (Almost) Daily drinker price for a super enjoyable expression of the Honey Orchid form. You will have to spend significantly more to get something better.

This was not a fussy tea to brew either.

I would absolutely 100% buy more of this tea.

Did 1st to last comparisons. 2nd infusion was that lovely stone fruit nose and brisk apricot palate, while penultimate was peaches and minerality on the nose rounded over peaches on palate, thick mouthfeel, and that finish. 1st infusion was that beautiful beginning aroma on the nose, similat palate as 2nd, but with a little baker’s chocolate, while last was light nose and very rounded over palate, suggesting that leaves were done.

I nibbled on some of the spent leaves and even they tasted good. This is seriously everything I look for in a Honey Orchid tea.

This was another recommendation from the Phoenix tea fanatic. Their recommendations have been very accurate so far.",8,DevOpsProDude,19a96f2,2024-01-18 CC Fine Tea Phoenix Mountain Oolong (Dancong) first tasting notes,27,4,,See comment for notes (absolutely stellar Dancong).,DevOpsProDude,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/19a96f2,1,1

199sgna,kihofz5,"This is a difficult question. There are definitely red flags I look for, but it's more about developing intuition than specific criteria. Every ""rule"" in tea has exceptions. That said, here are things I ask when evaluating a new vendor, starting with the big picture:

* **Do they specialize in a specific region, or are they more generalist?**  Would you rather trust a restaurant serving Indian, Chinese, Mexican *and* Italian food, or one specializing in northern Thai? Usually, specialists are higher quality.

* **Is their selection largely flavored teas?** Nobody is going to cover up amazing tea in flavorings, so this is a sign they value popularity over quality. 

* **How many teas do they sell?** If they have 500 teas, it's unlikely they're doing any real curation. And unless they're selling huge volumes, their more obscure teas may be years old. 

* **What teaware do they sell?** A store can have garbage teaware and great tea so this isn't an immediate dealbreaker, but if I see $50 ""Yixing"" pots, easy gaiwans, tea pets, tea balls, etc., I'll definitely be wary. Even more so if the product photos come straight from Taobao, as is the case with Jesse.

* **What are their brewing instructions?** If they give the same directions for entire categories, that's a huge red flag. Gyokuro and longjing are both green teas, but they're brewed nothing alike. Putting teaspoons instead of grams is also problematic, since leaf size can vary a lot. Recommending temperatures lower than boiling for categories like puer, oolong or black tea also gives me pause, since lowering the temperature is a way to hide flaws in bad tea. Honestly, many of the best vendors don't bother with brewing instructions at all. There are infinite ways to brew any tea, and they assume their customers are experienced enough to know what they prefer. Here's an example of a bad vendor.

After the big picture stuff, I'll look at specific categories. Puer is a good one, since most vendors fuck it up in obvious ways. If they only sell mini tuochas and flavored puer, that's a terrible sign. This listing doesn't even say whether it's raw or ripe, which matters a lot because they taste completely different. I'll also look at green teas. It's not always easy to judge tea quality from dry leaves, but if their green teas are brown, that's concerning. 

Others have already pointed out some obvious marketing red flags (although there are exceptions for all of them), like making wild health claims, overemphasizing qi, and exaggerating tree ages. Beyond that, a good strategy is to figure out who is their intended audience. I wrote this the other day:

>Compare this Upton Gyokuro to the same style from Thes du Japon, a respected Japanese tea vendor. Thes du Japon lists the harvest date, cultivar, shading time, and specific region of origin. Upton, on the other hand, doesn't even list the harvest *year.*

Between those, it's obvious that Thes du Japon's description is written for more sophisticated customers. Upton's could describe *any* gyokuro, and gives no useful information to someone already familiar with the category. Even without knowing anything about those teas, I think anyone could guess which is better. 

Here's another example. That's a super high-end vendor, so the description assumes their audience is already familiar with yancha, its cultivars, its terroirs, and how it's typically brewed. They give all the relevant information, but really the entire product page can be summed up as, ""Trust us. It's good."" Compare that to the same cultivar from Mei Leaf. Their audience is, apparently, people who need to watch a video to learn what a tea cultivar is. In other words, absolute beginners. And there's nothing wrong with appealing to novices—Thes du Japon does it well—but there's a difference between being beginner-friendly and treating beginners like morons who need their hands held. Mei Leaf is the latter.

Lastly, I'll try to find reviews from reliable sources (so...not Reddit). Tea Forum has some super knowledgeable people, or even old Steepster or Tea Chat threads if the vendor has been around for a while. Even still, there's no guaranteed way to judge a vendor. The only surefire solution is to taste a lot of tea and learn to recognize quality, then try a few teas from a new vendor before putting in huge orders. You'll still get some duds, but at least it will be minimized.",38,trickphilosophy208,199sgna,How do you research vendors before buying new tea?,32,35,,"I've subbed for a long time, but my interest in tea waxes and wanes.

**Red Blossom Tea Company** in San Francisco for any Chinese teas. Whether it be green, white, oolong or pu’erh. Their selection isn’t the largest or overwhelming, but what they do have is **GREAT**. They also ship and usually have some free shipping promo going on. 

**Harney and Sons** for any **flavored** teas. Emphasis on the **flavored**. Their Chinese and Indian teas are lackluster, honestly. But where they shine is their flavored tea blends.

199vnrw,kihotiv,"Assam black teas have a generally quite different flavor profile from Ceylon black teas (or Yunnan).

It is a inexpensive tea, but I recommend Ahmad Kalami Assam loose leaf. It has a hint of fruitiness I love, and is great with generous use of milk. Assam teas are pretty variable between malty/fruity/bitter depending on the tea, the leaf size, etc. Use a good heaping teaspoon of tea in a generous-sized cup or mug. Heat the water until it is _just_ beginning to boil (steaming, the first small bubbles starting), and then steep the tea for 3-4 minutes. Try that, and depending on your taste, you _might_ extend the steeping time. Note that Hong Kong style milk tea often uses evaporated milk and condensed milk, so using fresh milk would taste rather different. 

However, you might find that Assam just isn't your thing. It's a wide tea world out there. If you'd like to experiment with Ceylon tea, then affordable versions can be found. 

You should also try your black tea with the milk, since that's your goal. It's going to be a very different drinking experience without the milk and with. You're not after the same brewing goals here. You might even want to steep the tea to be stronger (steep a lot longer) than you'd want to drink straight, and then turn it into milk tea. Remember that things like Builder's Tea (in England) or Milk Tea (in Hong Kong), or even Indian Chai all originally became popular as robust and tasty beverages for laborers. They all make use of strong brews that might be harsh, but which were cheap, and then they were transformed by milk and sugar (and spice in the case of Indian Chai), to create joy out of poverty. Poor people made these things out of the tea that the fancy people wouldn't drink, originally. So, good milk tea might not be made from tea that you'd ever want to sip freshly brewed without any additions.",11,celticchrys,199vnrw,What should Assam tea taste like?,16,7,,"I mostly drink Chinese black tea from Yunnan.

199ng75,kifd2h8,Do you solely go with color when judging matcha?,4,ujihatea,199ng75,Judging Matcha By Color,13,6,image,"Judging matcha by color! Here's how.

Good matcha = bright green, like spring grass after rain. Think vibrant, almost electric green. This kind of green tells you the leaves were shaded just right and picked young, making it sweet and smooth.

Bad matcha = dull green, like old moss. Brown or yellow tinges are even worse. These colors mean the leaves were old or not shaded, so the matcha will be bitter and kinda bleh~ (vomit)

Think of it like traffic lights:

Bright green = GO! Grab this matcha, it's gonna be delicious.

Dull green = CAUTION. Maybe okay for baking, but not for sipping.

Brown or yellow = STOP! Run away, this matcha needs to go in the bin, not a cup.

Bonus tip: The deeper the green, the fancier the matcha. Think emerald jewels, not pea soup.

Remember, color isn't everything, but it's a great first impression. So next time you're choosing matcha, give it a good glance before you take the plunge.

Online Shopping?

Shopping for matcha online is tough! You can't see it for yourself, unlike in a store. That makes it hard to know if it's the right color.

Even photos are tricky. Phones and cameras can mess up the true color of things. This picture I took? Phone camera, no flash because it made it look yellow. I had to play with the brightness, colors, and light settings on my phone to get it closer to the real thing. Fancy editing software? Nope, just phone tricks. I got it mostly right, but not perfect.

Judging matcha by color? In person, it's a good way to go, but not totally reliable. Videos and pictures? Forget it!

The best way? Samples! Ask sellers for tiny amounts to try before you buy. That way, you can taste and see for yourself if it's the matcha you're looking for.

199qwgg,kiie7n0,I love eating sencha leaves with ponzu after brewing!,2,ShiitakeFriedClams,199qwgg,Gyokuro at Gion Tsujiri and Uji Fukujuen,8,2,,"Many moons ago, Gion Tsujiri used to offer this beautiful tea set on their menu. They actually had English instructions but maybe because I tried to act snobbish and ordered with my less than toddler level Japanese so the bad karma reward me with this Japanese instruction leaflet I have no clue how to read and yes they left me alone to brew this Gyokuro which I barely have idea of the perfect brewing.

Anyhow, after struggled with the whole ordeal. I managed to ""wing"" ahem ( read ""brew"") myself a cup of not too bad Gyokuro.


I think I don't have that gene for umami sweetness. I only taste like umami type saltiness. It was a fun experience though.

Next one was at Fukujuen, I think they came with English leaflet, and again you brew your own Gyokuro.

I can't really tell the differences though from these two places. 

BUT

Fukujuen let you eat the tea leaves afterwards. So you dip in ponzu/ yuzu ponzu sauce to eat the precious leaves!

I don't know if they still do it now but it is also a worthy experience for tea enthusiasts.

Also if you happen to visit Kyoto..

Perhaps not quite as good as at home, but very good. In Brazil tap water is usually good quality and decent tasting and tea is usually as expected / no complaints.

I have relatives in California and their water is really hard and I use filtered water or else the tea is noticeably affected.

You can basically taste the hardness. A brita filter doesn´t remove *all* ions, so for me it is shifting the concentration in a better direction.

I heard from multiple sources, that filtering water with a brita jug is a no brainer if you got hard water or any other issues with water.

I just tried it in the context of hard, but clean water and can't recommend the brita jug at all. Interestingly, the taste seems flatter, unpleasantly sweet and just a bit rounder.

\- Water: put to boil. Very drinkable Swiss tap water with \~100mg/l calcium. Two steps to reduce scale: 1. Multiple Scale catchers(looks like steel wool) in the kettle 2. Giving it a short rest, such that the small scale particles flow to the bottom. I throw the bottom 20% of the water away. Looks very milky, so seems a lot of minerals are in there.

\- Tea: Taiwanese Bi Luo chun. Very light, floral tea with an Oolong note, that was particularly muted by the Brita.

Especially during later brews, the Brita tea lacked deeper notes, complexity and florality. The tap water did have a bit of an aggressive mineral note, but it was overall better.

Disclaimer: This was according to my expectations, hence there might be bias involved. A local tea seller made similar experiences and told me prior. Also I am very used to drink tea made from this water.

Somebody has experience and thoughts about this scenario?

Maybe I need to do a blind taste...

Mountain Stream tea is in Taiwan, and has a nice sanxia green tea, no pre-order needed, but I'd wait till the fresh spring tea is listed.

I don't think it said on the packaging, but I'm pretty sure Republic of Tea had additional milk flavor added to it (I've seen a lot of arguments that it didn't, but I've never tasted pineapple that strong without added flavors, so I'd be surprised). If you've only tried that, it's definitely worth trying a ""real"" jin xuan milk oolong that doesn't have added flavoring, but it is going to be more subtle and floral. If you really do want that same strong flavor, just get a flavored tea.

199xyck,kii20y8,"Using this kind of  kettle's like a teapot will be just a nightmare. If you want a teapot I would suggest considering something else, like a glazed side handled kyusu, gaiwan, shiboridashi, Hairo kyusu (strainer is relatively law so it's ± ok), houhin etc. What is important is that every of them has some sort of a strainer (besides of hairo kyusu, the strainer is either built up, or a shape of the vessel itself works as a strainer like in say gaiwan, so you can pour small amount of leaves if you want, which is very good). If you are interested in materials that will affect the tea taste then you might be interested in unglazed teapots from clay, like tokoname clay, yixing clay etc.  you can read about it further. 

If you want some relatively big vessel that's convenient and will be quite neutral them I'd say that side handled glazed [glazed vessel will have neutral effect on tea] kyusu teapots are very good (they are my favorite for that purpose). Oftenly they are pretty big (say for example 400ml which is a  big amount for tea. You gonna to also remember that typically tea can be brewed multiple times), ans have built in strainer (typically around the spout or so, so the bottom of it is ""accesible"" for the leaves) so  the leaves are in contact with water no matter  how small amount of water you pour. You can also easily adjust  amount of water for your needs.

This kind of kettles you sent don't have deep strainers, at least I never saw one.

On the opposite end of the spectrum [Senbird TETSUBIN GEN teapot](https://senbirdtea.com/products/tetsubin-cast-iron-kettle-teapot-gen) is $250.

I still can't be 100% certain but given their price point and website, I would trust their enamel interior is made without nanotech. However, I find very little in terms of outside reviews on this $250 product, which is concerning since I would hope it would be good enough quality to last a lifetime and be passed down as a heirloom.

In Leiden there is also a store that sells high end french tea from Mariage Frères (Exclusivithee). Some tea is delicious but it is above my paygrade.. 

In Haarlem there is The Art of Tea and Spices. This store is giant. They have so many teas, cups, pots, everything. Haarlem actually has a couple of tea stores.

In most cities you can find at least one tea store (Simon Levelt). It depends on where you live, but google maps is a great friend! Everytime I visit a city I go to the local tea store (not Simon Levelt).
So if you find it hard to decide what to get online or the delivery time is too long, my advise is to go to a tea store and ask them for advise.

Empty cup had aromas of plums.

Camphor on nose increased on 5th infusion.

Mouthfeel was enjoyable silkiness with some astringency.

Palate was brisk smokiness on 6th infusion.
Finish was dark cherries and maybe some plums. I kept thinking “juicy” while drinking this puerh.

This sheng was like Thick Zen Supremacy Electric Boogaloo in 3D. You can read that review here: 

Where Thick Zen was forest floor and mushrooms, with thick apricot finish, this puerh is smoke, camphor, and thick dark cherry/plum finish.

Did first to last comparisons. 2nd infusion was light smoke and sweet cherries, while penultimate was rounded over dark stone fruit. 1st was very light nose with camphor palate, while last was rounded over, but the leaves still had one or two infusions left to give if I were so inclined (I was not as it was late).

This tea had excellent endurance and was very plug and play (easy to brew enjoyably with predictable infusion intervals).

Looking at TWG, theirs says “citrus flavors”, which implies that they are using more than just bergamot, so you might want to look for a Citrus Earl Grey. Also, Lady Grey teas sometimes have more citrus than just bergamot. 

For myself, I like Harney & Sons regular Earl Grey and then I add flavors to it as it appeals to me. I use their Super Blue Lavender to make lavender Earl Grey or I’ll use a homemade oleosaccharum to add extra citrus and sweet.

199qpcp,kig4l2q,"I rode my bike through Sri Lanka about 7 years ago - loads of fun, and I learned a lot. Tea is what people drink in Sri Lanka. Folks there say the best tea is for export, but the typical local swill in cafés and tiny restaurants was just fine by my standards. 

Specific to tea: by riding from Kandy to Nuwara Eliya, I rode past many tea plantations, and saw tea being tended and picked. I took some rest stops at plantations and drank tea at them. 

From Nuwara Elilya, I toured an ""ethical"" tea plantation near the Lover's Leap area. Our tour took us through the processing plant, where tea was dried and graded. They had huge sacks of tea stacked in a warehouse - I am not sure where they go to for packaging for export from there. 

As we descended into Ella, I stopped at various tea shops along the way.

There are downsides to cycling through the tea regions - the climb up to Nuwara Eliya was endless, and an icy rainstorm broke out near the summit. The section to Ella had lots of ups and downs, and we had another wild rainstorm. (Sri Lanka had the heaviest rain storms I've ever ridden through, and I've done a fair bit of international touring.)

1992x7f,kibb0jy,"I'm an avid coffee enjoyer as well as a former barista, and I will say that tea offerings at cafes are so often quite dreadful. If you focus on having high quality coffee, I think your tea quality should match. Amazon isn't a great place to get high quality tea, I would recommend looking at getting a wholesale account with a tea supplier, as the tea will be considerably cheaper this way as well as allow you to get higher quality tea. I'd recommend a brand like Hugo Tea, which has a paired back, refined selection of teas that are generally approachable, as well as within your price range. A couple others to look at may be Royal Tea New York(although their minimum purchase requirements are quite high), The Tao of Tea, even Rishi tea as well as a few more brands that aren't coming to me right now are all great places to get teas for a coffee shop. My former employer also has a decent tea selection available wholesale(primarily consisting of approachable blends if that's your thing). 

Generally for teas you wanna stock:

Some sort of chai(always a big seller)
Herbal blends(caffeine free)
And depending on how much tea you guys sell, likely one tea from the main types of tea(black/red, oolong, green, white)

As for specific teas it really depends on your demographic. If you've got a base appreciating super high quality coffee then I'd recommend finding some equally high quality teas(maybe even some puers), but in a lot of area blends, traditional breakfast style teas, and standard quality oolongs and greens may be more fitting.

You can use the metal plate thingy as a lid while brewing, you will lose more heat from your teapot though which might lead to a weaker brew in the end, but it shouldn't be too terrible. It certainly won't mess it up.   


I'd also suggest heating up the teapot before brewing to keep things warm, by filling it with warm water for a few minutes, and then pouring that out, before brewing. Quite a lot of heat is lost just warming up the pot.

199fi4l,kiewlky,"The only teas I've tried from Jenier was a gift of their Balmoral blend, which was almost impressively bitter when steeped longer than 2 minutes in typical British style. I wouldn't buy that one. And their scottish blend which is fairly frequently found in b&bs, hotels etc in scotland. The one you have should be fine as a general British tea like their scottish blend

Just try a typical British style brew with that, soft water given that it's a Yorkshire blend, a rounded teaspoon per cup plus one for the pot, just boiling water, milk and some sugar should you desire to balance any tannic dryness. You'll need to try a variety of steep time as everyone's taste is different, two minutes to five is typical.

I had a shower thought today that made me smile. You know how in many cultures, table wine is a staple at meals, something that’s always there, enjoyed without much fanfare but deeply appreciated? Well, I realized that in the South, iced tea holds a similar place of honor.

It’s fascinating how iced tea is so deeply ingrained in Southern culture. It’s more than just a beverage; it’s a symbol of hospitality, comfort, and home. Whether you’re at a family gathering, a local diner, or even a fancy restaurant, iced tea is always there, quietly making every meal a little bit better.

I love how it varies from place to place too. Some like it sweet, some prefer it unsweetened, and then there are those adventurous souls who add a twist of lemon or mint. It’s like each glass tells a story of the person who made it.

In a way, iced tea is the unsung hero of Southern cuisine. It doesn’t ask for attention, yet it’s an essential part of the experience. It’s the perfect companion to everything from barbecue to a simple sandwich.

Just wanted to share this thought with you all. Next time you sip on a glass of iced tea, maybe think about the role it plays in our culture. Cheers to the tablewine of the South!

However, the real revelation came when I tried Luzianne. There’s something about its smooth, robust flavor that just hits the spot perfectly. It’s like it was tailor-made for those hot Southern days.

1992qmz,kicudp5,"I used to think of the way we drank iced tea as southern sangria or sorts.  Really cold tea piled with peaches and berries or apples and pears.  Sometimes several kinds of mint and lemon balm, tarragon and rose pedals.  Basically whatever you could stretch tea with that was cheap and available and not have to use sugar.  

I am not exactly sure where this came from as most everyone else maybe a bit of lemon or mint in theirs with tons of sugar, but I believe my German-swiss Oma was one of the biggest reasons.  Refined sugar was something that was insanely expensive when she was a kid so that usually was only for the most special things. Fruit though, that grew on trees in the back yard, the mint would grow over a meter high so you had to keep it down somehow.  

The only difference in the way that I make iced tea now is I do cold crash mine.  I love my iced tea super fresh, so I'm not going to wait for it to cool down.  Ice cubes and frozen fruit and bam...

I'm not unfamiliar with this type of thing, I used to do Lsd and it was very similar but of course much more powerful in terms of creative potential

It's weird but whenever I ingest any kind of substance (I haven't done lsd in a year btw), so now tea but whenever I do, its like my brain goes from this messed up state of inability of concentrating on literally anything to being able to connect with itself and build a potent and beautiful structure that can generate beautiful and suprising creative ideas that are otherwise impossible sober.

I also want to say that I am the type of person who always tries to be in the flow state, I like to listen to music deeply which I do while I drink the tea, I listen to music and write and tea helps like go deeper into it, not comparable to lsd where you Are inside the music but its still impressive.

Is there any reason for this?

An example is its been barely like 10 minutes since I began this post and I faced no obstacle trying to write it and I didn't feel a sense of time while writing it.

Can meditation help increase this state or atleast reduce the need for too much tea?

also forgot to mention, I kinda don't feel good or more like my mood goes bad easily normally but with tea, there is atleast a slight uplift in the mood which helps me actually work.

I also want to say that I am the type of person who always tries to be in the flow state, I like to listen to music deeply which I do while I drink the tea, I listen to music and write and tea helps like go deeper into it, not comparable to lsd where you Are inside the music but its still impressive.

Is there any reason for this?

An example is its been barely like 10 minutes since I began this post and I faced no obstacle trying to write it and I didn't feel a sense of time while writing it.

Can meditation help increase this state or atleast reduce the need for too much tea?

also forgot to mention, I kinda don't feel good or more like my mood goes bad easily normally but with tea, there is atleast a slight uplift in the mood which helps me actually work.

198pxm0,kidxzou,"It’s difficult to recommend one specific tea because there’s so many different types. I recommend to Google the “categories of tea” that exist, i.e. black, white, green, oolong, puer etc. Read a little bit about how those generally tend to taste, and then decide which taste profile you think you would prefer. Let’s say you choose black tea, then Google “types of black tea” and read until you find a specific black tea that you find interesting. 

If you want to go straight to high quality tea, ordering from White2Tea or Yunnan Sourcing is a great choice. Just try some mini samples and see what you like. Then order bigger amounts, after you know what you want. Or just find some local vendor that imports good quality loose tea from i.e. China, Japan, Taiwan, India etc. You can also read a bit about these countries’ tea to find out what you like. For example, Japan is known for producing very umami, fresh ocean-like tasting green teas.

As someone who tries basic UK and Irish teas for the fun of it, I notice that the tiny differences in bagged teas can taste “off” at first, but after a couple of days you get used to the flavor. However, with an exceptionally good tea, it tastes excellent immediately. For example, I’m currently trying Thompson’s Teas from Northern Ireland. Their Irish Breakfast is an absolute stunner and didn’t require any “getting used to it” time - unlike their Scottish blend, which really did. 

I’ve recently tried Brook37 Magnificent Mile, an Assam Orthodox. It’s bagged in the biodegradable bags, but it’s a high quality tea that you can see through the bag.

The western pine-smoked teas that go by this name are not often found in the Chinese market as you have found (I once took some to a high-end Chinese tea importer to ask if they had a higher grade version, but they scoffed and said ""this is not a Chinese tea."").  Instead you more often find the pine-dried (not smoked) version or electric-dried modern versions.  Those often go under the other name, Zheng Shan Xiao Zhong, which is written with the same characters, but I often come across Chines vendors that refer to it by both names in the same listing.  They both refer to small-leaf black teas originating in the Wuyi region.

So, long story short, Chinese tea producers discovered that some foreign markets like the extra-smoked version of the tea and make it for export, and the common name for it just became lapsang souchong through use rather than it's other name.",11,EarnestWilde,1990t1n,Lapsang Souchong,4,5,,"I have tried Lapsang Souchong from two different Chinese suppliers and both are very different from Lapsang Souchong from western brands.

This tea has been imported under the obscure 1392 brand. Oolongs have been the tea type that has given me issues, I've struggled with brewing them and I've found it hard to find one that appeals to me. This is the first one that has, having tasted it at the tea house yesterday I picked up 30g to trial and review.

The material looked good to my untrained eye, nice sweet and baked smell, little breakage and seemingly well rolled. 7g@140ml for 1:20 ratio, brewed at 100 degrees unless mentioned

I did 5 flash steeps before a 5, 10, 30 and 60 second brew for a total of 9 steeps. Very immediate and forward sweetness throughout the whole session, a gentle tannic taste with slight vegetal and baked notes as the liquor cools. A slightly deeper charcoal taste is brought forward in later steeps.

The aroma is amazing, when smelling close to the liquor, the smell is of baked dough and nuts, little sweetness. As you smell from a bit further away, the floral notes are amazing and so in your face it's like sniffing a bouquet. The empty cup smells incredibly sweet like cookies.

The qi is minimal, slightly focusing but otherwise nothing going on. After the first two steeps there is a  cooling and minty taste on the tongue that grows stronger in subsequent steeps. The bitterness drops off after the 4th steep and there's plenty of sweetness combined with the nearly minty menthol effect. The tea will keep up for maybe 12-15 steeps if you're willing to extend your steeping times.

Overall, very good. I can imagine enjoying this when I (rarely) want an oolong, or as an easy offer to people who don't drink tea. I would bring it up to 9 or so grams (1:15) to tease out more longer lasting bitterness as it dropped off a bit too quick for me. Most importantly I can see why people like oolongs now.

The aroma is amazing, when smelling close to the liquor, the smell is of baked dough and nuts, little sweetness. As you smell from a bit further away, the floral notes are amazing and so in your face it's like sniffing a bouquet. The empty cup smells incredibly sweet like cookies.

The qi is minimal, slightly focusing but otherwise nothing going on. After the first two steeps there is a  cooling and minty taste on the tongue that grows stronger in subsequent steeps. The bitterness drops off after the 4th steep and there's plenty of sweetness combined with the nearly minty menthol effect. The tea will keep up for maybe 12-15 steeps if you're willing to extend your steeping times.

Overall, very good. I can imagine enjoying this when I (rarely) want an oolong, or as an easy offer to people who don't drink tea. I would bring it up to 9 or so grams (1:15) to tease out more longer lasting bitterness as it dropped off a bit too quick for me. Most importantly I can see why people like oolongs now. It's important to widen my horizons to make sure I'm not missing stuff I'll enjoy, there's a long way to go but this was a nice stop.",zhongcha,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/198u583,1,1

198l0vi,ki7xvi1,"Brewed Gong Fu style. 8.6 g dragon ball of tea to 80ish ml water at 212 F. Gaiwan, cha hai, cup warmed. Tea steamed. 2 x flash steeps. 5 seconds, 10 s, 15 s, 20s, 25s, 30 s, 35 s, 40 s, 45 s, 50 s, 55 s, 1 minute, 1.5 m, 2 m, 3m, 5 m, 10 m

Steamed ball had aromas of dates.

Smoke on the nose.
Dark raisins on the palate.
Nice lightly sweet cherry finish.
Silky mouthfeel with nice astringency.

Camphor crept into the nose by 9th infusion.

This tea was pretty bold, which was a nice change of pace from some of the thinner teas I tried recently, particularly from White2Tea.

By 12th infusion, smoke and camphor had receded a bit and raisins became more prominent.
Palate evolved to be more muscat grapes and cherries by this time. Finish followed suit.

This tea had good endurance.

Did first to last comparisons. 2nd infusion was smoke on the nose and light sweetness, while penultimate was muscat grapes on the nose and rounded raisin fruits with that finish. 1st infusion was just very light all around, while last was very rounded showing the leaves had nothing more to give.

This tea is a good representation of the raisiny profile. It hit all the right notes and nothing was out of place.

19992um,kidzkhj,"It’s a possibility sure. I mean the tea hobby has grown pretty well at least for Chinese tea that is. I think it’s a matter of market research and testing. U could probably narrow down to inoffensive teas like perhaps dragonwell, fujian blacks, and anxi oolongs etc. would be my guess. Those are major steps above things like earl grey. I would imagine the hardest obstacle would be reaching people beyond who are already in the hobby. But don’t forget there’s other means to education whether it be a blog or YouTube channel. There’s definitely a lack of a channel that produces consistent reviews of teas from really any of the popular vendors. One of the biggest issues I see with people who are new to the hobby is the vast and overwhelming amount of things to understand before they even try a single tea which tends to paralyze them from purchasing. But if there’s a reviewer of popular teas from popular vendors outlining exactly what a certain tea has to offer, now that could be interesting.",3,user987632,19992um,"Is there such a job as ""tea consultant""?

Because they are sourced  differently and you get only information about the rough origin area and the elevation. And next year, when weather was different and the leaves oxidized a few minutes more or less, everything is slightly different again.

Pinch of coriander seeds

Sugar to taste (chai should be very sweet)

Equipment:

I like Adagio and I think many of their blends are great. It just depends what you're looking to drink. For my plain teas, I usually shop at what-cha for a good balance between price and high quality.

I've tried a few teas from the Adagio masters site and was nicely surprised. Their ali shan special is one of my all time favorite teas.

I will say that their teapots absolutely suck though. I got a teapot from them years ago as a gift and it just dribbles tea like that's its one purpose in life.

198f9au,ki6tfam,"Brewed Gong Fu style. 5 g tea to 50ish ml water at 212 F. Gaiwan, cha hai, cup warmed. Tea steamed. 5 seconds, 10 s, 15 s, 15 s, 20 s, 25 s, 30 s, 35 s, 45 s, 1 minute, 1.5 m, 2 m, 3 m, 5 m, 10 m

Steamed leaf aromas dominated by cooked apricots.

Apricots and floral notes on the nose with a touch of malt.
Apricots with a little charcoal on the palate to start.
Nice mellow lightly sweet apricot finish.
Mouthfeel was nice and silky.

At around the 9th infusion, nose was somewhat more rounded.

Aromas from empty cup included peaches and vanilla.

This is a tea that never really strays from its true nature as an apricot delivery system. If you’re looking for a tea that evolves significantly over a Gong Fu session, this is not it, however, if you’re looking for a tea that beautifully presents apricot notes throughout, this dancong has what you need.
Longevity was about average, which is too bad, because I could drink this all day.

Did 1st to last comparisons. 2nd infusion was refreshing brisk apricots, while second to last (penultimate) was rounded apricots and maybe some woodiness. 1st was apricots with a little dark chocolate, while last was very rounded showing that the leaves were done.

This tea was recommended to me by a dancong fanatic that I trust and this is why I trust their recommendations. They are so on the money.

I am very new to the tea game; just got into it a few weeks ago. Through the internet Ive seen oriental beauty be labeled as a good beginner tea because its pretty sweet. So I got some from Meileaf(I know hes a controversial figure in here, but I also heard he has decent tea.) I was very excited for it, and just brewed some up gongfu style literally about an hour ago(195F and 20 second steep.) I had high hopes for this tea and I dont mean to offend anyone, but it was literally disgusting. It was sweet dont get me wrong. I tasted lot of fruits and such. But most of what I tasted was just straight tobacco. It threw me so off guard because the dry leaves smelled so great, which made me more excited. I literally gagged when I smelled the wet leaves. I had no idea it was gonna taste like that. The taste is still in my mouth as we speak. Again, I mean no harm to anyone who loves this tea. Im just sharing my experience. I will probably give it another try in the future. And one last thing. I would love to maybe know what other popular teas may have this same tobacco flavor so I can avoid? And also is there anything I can do with my temp and steep time to maybe make it better? Again not trying to spread any negativity. Just curious.

198q0sw,ki9gpp3,"You probably won't like heavily oxidized/fermented oolongs, of which oriental beauty is, or possibly ""Chinese black teas"" either.  Assamica black teas might be all right, but if there's some oxidized/fermented flavors that you're not vibing with, then you might not like those either.  Maybe the astringency of assamicas can overpower that oxidized/fermented tea taste you don't like though.

Oriental beauty isn't supposed to be roasted much, but you should still avoid heavily roasted tea too if you don't like the flavors you mentioned.  

Stick with green teas and/or lightly oxidized oolongs.  Unless you also don't like grassy/vegetal flavors...

Actually now that I finished typing this all out I kind of just want to delete it all and say... Just keep trying different teas until you find one you like. And if you don't, then tea isn't for you.

1986idu,ki56gdh,"Your ""gold standard"" and ""Canada"" and even ""vast selection"" are not going to go well together. 

You can try Tao Tea Leaf on Yonge, Tea Joint, or even Delish Tea in Scarborough.  Each have really great teas, and some fair to middling teas, but each have a relatively narrow range of really good teas. 

Personally, I'd argue that ""gold standard"" sellers are highly specialized.  A gold standard puerh seller will not be a gold standard Fenghuang dancong seller.  ""Vast selection"" shops are kind of like Amazon for teas; low to mid fair quality for most, because they're not curated or selected, they're just stored to resell. 

Use a generalist to identify the types of tea you like and then seek gold standard specialists.",4,wudingxilu,1986idu,"New to tea, need help on where to buy out of Toronto, Canada",3,16,,"Have a pot coming, really excited to delve into loose leaf, except I have no tea to brew 🥲

I don’t think you’ll find anything in American grocery stores; what you need is Japanese sencha, but Japan produces shit tons of sencha so it won’t necessarily be too expensive - cheaper than buying bottles for sure.  Somebody else can probably name a good vendor that sells decent sencha in bulk; I’ve only used one and it was on the expensive end. So find a good vendor of decent sencha, and then cold brew it. IMO overnight room temperature is better than fridge cold, but in any case it’s easy, set it at night strain it in morning, don’t worry about timing really.

197h07b,ki0z3sk,"I'm interested as well. What is your growing zone? Where did you get the plant?

I don't know about containers. One of my relatives has a tea farm in China. There are 3 general types of tea plants: Tall arbor type, Dwarf bush type, and the in-betweener. I suppose you can technically Bonsai all 3 types in containers.

In addition, there are natural cultivars and modified asexual cultivars. The natural ones are more likely to flower and die because that's what an organism wants. To breed the next generation.

Most farms don't grow from seeds because the property of the plant will be unstable. Like if you grow apples from the seed of a Gala, it will not grow into Gala apple tree. Most farms use asexual cultivars in combination with grafting.

I think the fundamental problem is the genetics of your plant. Even tea farmers have trouble growing tea plants from seeds. It's the reason behind the tragedy of the death of Tie-Guan-Yin in the 80s and 90s, when farmers rip out old plants to grow young plants to increase yield, only to find they are unable to grow new ones, or new plants don't taste good.

Maybe it's not you. It's the plant.

If everything is fine, maybe you need to pick the leaves more often to prevent flowering. Like with basil.

While I love different herbal(and green/white teas sometimes) teas and drink it daily as a healthy, medicinal drink which also feels ritualistic with little meditation.
I have never dreamt about drinking it though. 🤷
It seems to help me with sleep(herbal ones, or theanine which is a substance found in green tea) a lot cause I don't like having lots of dreams, it can be very difficult if you have experienced traumatic experiences. I sometimes wake up in a full blown panic from it, and in really rough ones it can take a long while just to process the shocking horror I experienced at night. 

And sometimes it can leave me terrified, it feels like I was traumatized in my sleep - this doesn't help considering the previous traumas I have been recovering from slightly resurface if I dream about something related to the events I went through.

One thing that helps a lot against dreams is CBD tea but I only have it on the weekends.

I know that this sub is for the tea plant tea but...
If you like green tea, you really need to try like all herbal teas, you will be amazed when you realize that green/black/white tea is just one herb of quite many that are very beneficial and can used as a tea. The green tea is just the gateway to the even more(depending on what but most are very good for you) healthier herbal teas. 🙂

I have tried over 100 herbals/teas, there is quite a lot of options, tastes, different benefits and fits different purposes depending on which kind etc. There is a whole world to explore if you have only tried like mint, chamomile and green/black tea. 

Going to make some tea with krishna tulsi, rooibos, thyme leaf and yerba mate - maybe will add some anise (star anise is even better but both are nice teas). That sounds delicious and beneficial for your mind, energy and bodily health.",0,FollowTheCipher,196zbjx,Does anyone else daydream about what kind of tea you’re gonna have the next day ??,60,21,,,sakeyzoso,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/196zbjx/does_anyone_else_daydream_about_what_kind_of_tea/,0,1

1975lx2,khypzlv,"Congratulations on your sobriety!!

Tea can be a great evening ritual and you can make it as involved and expensive or as easy and cheap as you’d like.

To  get started with loose leaf you’ll need a way to heat water, something to get the tea leaves out of the infusing vessel and something to drink from. 

Most simple would be heating up water, pouring it into a mug and then putting your sleepy herbs into an infusing basket and then dunking that in the water. I don’t like the infusers that are small with large mesh as the tea leaves can’t really expand and the smaller bits escape. I like things like this!

You could also get a pot to brew your tea in. My local tea house owners say this ForLife pot is the one they use most often. 

How simple or involved you go can adjust based on your interest and how much you want to spend. 

For the actual “tea” you are drinking - please note that herbals are not technically tea. Some people get upset when folks mix up the names. What you are drinking is a tisane or herbal infusion. There are lots of great herbs for evening. Camomile is one of my favorites, and I sometimes grow it in my herb garden!  You could also check out health food stores or small pharmacies as some will have a bulk section where they will scoop some out of a big jar for you. You can learn about mixing them.

19786q0,khynfhx,"Drank an entire large thermos of CBSé Guaraná in the morning, after a rough night, and followed up with a generic, somewhat oversteeped sencha.

But the main new thing is that I've opened the last Verde Mate sample, an ""IQ"" blend with ginseng, gingko, guaraná etc. It just so happens that I've been drinking a lot of the ""same"" blend from Mate Green, another presumably Polish brand, in recent months which begs some questions about supply chains. These are both very similar on paper, not in practice though. The Mate Green version is much darker and slightly bitter, whereas Verde Mate adds little pieces of orange peel (very noticeable), pineapple and cornflowers, resulting in an overall lighter infusion. So the two probably aren't the same, unless the MG bag is mislabeled entirely (I originally bought it as only guaraná, thinking it'd be like the CBSé blend).",8,iwasjusttwittering,19786q0,"What's in your cup?

19786q0,ki0ldzx,"A friend of my wife gave her a piece of a pu-erh cake they brought back from China, with pictures of the wrapper and a request to identify it.  

It is a ripe Yiwu cake and says it is a gong ting (made of grade 1 small leaf).  However in the materials listing on the back it also says it is gu shu (old tree).  That seems contradictory to me, as old tree material is usually plucked as larger leaf - it would be prohibitively difficult to harvest only grade 1 tender leaf from mature trees, let alone old trees, so I was under the assumption gong ting was pretty much exclusively a plantation bush type of tea.  Certainly it doesn't seem to be a type of tea affordable to a casual tourist if old-tree gong ting is really a thing.

Indeed the cake looks like smaller leaf and plenty of more golden young leaf, but too large to be consistent with grade 1 (I'd say grade 3, perhaps 2).  

I'm thinking this is just a nice smaller-leaf spring cake, not gong ting and probably not gu shu.  Perhaps not even Yiwu.  Still it does taste nice.  I just wish tea producers wouldn't be afraid to label tea for what it really is - I think they underestimate the appeal of small-production and mostly unknown producing areas to western drinkers as niche teas are seen as exotic and exclusive rather than undesirable.",3,EarnestWilde,19786q0,"What's in your cup?

196pc3r,khxe0y0,"I think the sub is having an identity crisis at the moment.  There’s the camp of tea snobs that want to talk about Taiwanese oolong varietals and what the REAL meaning behind the name “duck shit” who are kind of the evergreen power users imo, and the more casual camp of people who want to talk about herbal remedies and their favorite flavor from the grocery store (bigelow perfectly mint).  

Browsing posts here feels like I mixed two unrelated subs together, with people mostly avoiding the posts that aren’t aimed at their camp.  Every now and then though the camps collide and it’s always a dumpster fire.  The tea snobs feel like their only corner on the internet is getting run over with misinformation and garbage fluff posts while the casual group feels demeaned and degraded by a weird group of trolls who keep telling them they’re not drinking “real” tea, they’re drinking something called a “tinsane”.  There’s threads where people ask for recommendations on where to buy tea, and you’ll have one comment thread where people are arguing about target vs Whole Foods, and and another comment thread where people are arguing about W2T v whatcha v YS.  These are obviously two completely different discussions and it’s crazy that it’s in the same comment section.

Personally, I think the sub moderation should cater more to tea snobs.  People come here to learn more about tea, which, speaking from experience, is a surprisingly opaque topic full of misinformation that is very hard to dissect on your own.  There are a bunch of users here who genuinely have an insane amount of tea knowledge, which like I mentioned, is worth its weight in gold given how much misinformation is out there.  I do think the weird 4chan-esque shitpost language from a lot of the snobs (which I think comes from r/puer’s community tbh) should get toned down, but I think for a lot of tea experts, they get very exhausted and frustrated when people are just incessantly posting things that are completely false.  I think some more resources and post guidelines would help keep things more on topic, but at the end of the day it would require moderators to start drawing lines on what the sub is and isn’t.",42,ya_bebto,196pc3r,/r/tea is taking applications for new moderators,61,59,,"Hello everyone!

196k43f,ki6ky56,"I love these very practical infusers (image link only, because the product page I ordered from now shows a slightly different variant that I would not use), I think you can find them from other sellers on Amazon or Etsy.

I like this style of infuser, plugging the top with some slightly-too-large silicone, because it stays secured, even if submerged, but is also easy to open. I've only had it open accidentally one time in over a year (happened yesterday, actually), I pulled it up a little too quickly/forcefully and some suction pulled the bottom off.

I like this *design* in *particular*, because the flower catches on the lip of your vessel, keeping the infuser up toward the top and easy to remove from the drink. Meanwhile, the stem is just long enough that I can use it to brew in my preferred 20oz thermos, and still leave like an inch to add milk (most infusers that can hang over the lip, assume you'll fill to the top).

I hate the ones with the vice grippers, because invariably some little bits of tea get caught between the lips, holding the infuser open and allowing some leaves to escape that way. I hate the ones where you have to kind of screw a top and bottom together (typically found on a little chain), because over time they get out of shape and don't hold together well (disgorging the leaves into your drink).

I can't use it too well with my thermos, but if brewing in a medium-to-large mug, I really enjoy this ""infusinator"", because it provides ample room for leaves to blossom during brewing.",1,micahcowan,196k43f,Favorite steeping capsule?,66,20,,"I’ve had this umbra for over a decade now, and it has served me so well.

196us65,khx71v3,"Absolutely do not wash. When making black tea, the leaves are essentially juiced in a controlled way. That juice then dries on the leaves and redissolves in the first 20s or so when you brew it. If you rinse, you throw away that juice and the associated flavours, which can be quite sweet and fruity.

Try it yourself, make a mini brew with 7g/100mL equivalent of leaves and steep for 20s, then taste. Use like a 50mL vessel or something to reduce your leaf use. You'll see in that short, srong brew the flavour notes you're discarding. 

The only teas I rinse are aged loose leaf teas, as they can genuinely have dust etc on them. I also rinse very broken tea leaves to try and remove some of the smallest broken leaves, but it's not common for me to drink broken leaf tea.

I do think you can, in principle, rinse any tea besides black tea and steamed green teas (like sencha etc) though - if rinsing takes your fancy.

196us65,khy9nxd,"There are two reasons why this isn't a particularly good idea. 

1) Black tea is processed in a way where the leaves are rolled to break cell structures and allow oils to be released and oxidise, this means the extraction of these very aromatic compounds is much faster than tea varieties that haven't undergone this process. 

2) Breakfast tea is generally processed in a way which breaks up the tea leaves into fragments, massively increasing the surface area for extraction, as well as breaking up more of the cell structure and causing much faster extraction than normal. 

With these two things in mind, you aren't ""waking up"" the leaf in this case, you basically extracting a fair amount of desirable aromatics then discarding them. There is one popular youtuber who I would say is very guilty of encouraging things like rinses on black tea, and doing things like gongfu brewing on broken leaf Indian teas, but I would avoid doing this for a typically desirable outcome.

196ys2u,khx8w55,"You probably are worrying you'll waste them, don't worry you won't. These are remarkably easy to brew. 

Assuming you're brewing gongfu style you'll want at least a 120ml gaiwan or pot. Rinse for 15 seconds in boiling water, pour the rinse and steam for a minute by leaving the lid on. You could give it a quick second rinse after. Try and pour down the side for these instead of into the Puer that is stuffed in the middle. These will open up the leaves.

Then continue by flash steeping these for at least 3 or 4 brews. You can pour into the tea directly to get thick dark soupy liqour or on the outside for lighter brews that will give you more steeps. As the colour lightens you can add 3-5 seconds for one or two steeps and then add 5 seconds for each subsequent brew. Once you hit 20s steep times, you may continue until the tea is exhausted with increasingly light brews or until you are finished.

If you wish to brew in a more standard fashion I would suggest getting a thick teapot if you have one, a teapot with candle warmer, or a regular stovetop pot. Place the tangerine in 500mls to 1liter of water. Preheat any teapot you use to ensure it stays warm. You'll want to brew for 7 minutes or until you get a thick dark liquor, hard to see through without a torch. This might be 15 minutes with 1L of water. If you have a teapot warmer, set the pot on that during the brew to keep it's heat. If you are using a stovetop pot keeping the brew at the lowest simmer you can manage will do well.

The other option, and best by my personal preference, is one of those hot and cold water fountains with the 5 gallon jug of premium spring water.

196fje6,khwourd,"Japanese (green) teas are steamed whereas Chinese teas are pan fired. 

The steaming of the leaves lets the tea keep it's distinct green color in terms of the unbrewed leaves, but especially in the color of the tea once brewed. A Japanese green tea (look up a cup of sencha if you want an example) when brewed gives an undeniably green liquid.

Chinese teas on the other hand usually undergo a process literally referred to as ""kill-green"" where the pan firing of the leaves removes the green color for the most part. You can still find Chinese teas which have visibly green leaves, but they absolutely lack the same shade as Japanese leaves. Once brewed, the difference becomes all the more clear as it'll typically give a pale yellow color.

The reason why steaming gives a different color than pan firing is because when making green tea, the leaves need to be heated to just around 150° F (66° C) to stop oxidation. The longer that it takes to reach this temperature, the more green the leaves are. Given that pan firing heats the leaves to the desired temperature faster than steaming, Japanese green teas are as a result much greener while Chinese green teas are more likely to be brown.

196fje6,khwna87,"Japanese greens are usually steamed immediately after picking so they end up taking on a very dark green colour as more chlorophyll remains in the leaves. Japanese sencha is almost always rolled into very fine needles as well, so the leaf shapes are pretty distinctive too.

Processing methods for Chinese greens are more varied, but they are often withered first and then pan fried, i.e. using dry heat. As a result they have comparatively lighter colours, ranging from very light green to jade green. The shape of the leaves vary widely and can look flattened, twisted, or rolled depending on the specific tea.

These are very broad distinctions however, and there are of course some exceptions.",8,visualogistics,196fje6,Please help me identify this green tea. Drank it some time ago while on holiday.

I'm new-ish to buying tea online as I've mostly bought from conventions or tea farms in my travels. I'm not used to buying online without smelling, tasting, or talking to someone about the teas, so I liked how they describe the notes and origins as well.

I find the ability to watch the water boil and bubble quite therapeutic. Maybe you weren't wanting the glass look, but I like it much better than my stainless steel one I had before, and definitely the plastic one I had before that... I do a process for my tea though. I get my water to temp in the kettle, let it sit for a moment while I add sweetener to a teapot, then pour it over my tea in said teapot, close the lid, add my cosy over the pot, wait and then add milk or lemon off wanted, stir and pour my tea into the waiting cup. It always makes my day if someone wants to share a cup of tea with me, so I usually make enough to share. In my experience, tea leaves should never ever reach a boiling point, bitterness will be released if they do. I live in the South (Georgia), this even goes for sweet iced tea.

Edit: This was not an uncharitable post, I tried to voice my concern in a genuine way without being rude. I was in no way trying to “drive tea enthusiasts away” from this sub…? All I was doing was bringing light to something I’ve seen around here, regardless of if it’s genuinely trying to be given as advice or not. Some people brought up a good point that “tea” can be taken as a hobby or simply as a drink, and when you mix those two groups of people, chaos can happen…as shown in these comments, lol. Again, I wasn’t trying to be uncharitable with this post, yet many of you here were being uncharitable to me. I guess that’s the internet for you, lol!

Edit 2: Reading comprehension: I’m not saying that tea enthusiasts shouldn’t be allowed on THEIR OWN SUB, go ahead and be obsessed and nerdy about tea! You can do that on this sub! I’m not talking about people who like to be snobby with their tea, I’m talking about people who USE THAT SNOBBINESS to be RUDE TO OTHERS.",Sufficient_Pay_820,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/195xnl9/the_amount_of_disrespect/,0,1

196lben,khumrri,"It’s a recently popular type of pu’er. The name literally means “loose silver”, referring to a time when silver was used for currency, one would take small pieces (loose, or broken) of silver to use as money. In this case, the tea leave shapes are small and pebble like, so they got this cute name. However, when I googled the term, I did find some site claiming this is really just a marketing gimmick to create a new product to promote sales. The marketing slogan is “I’d rather have 1 cup of loose silver than 10 cups of pu’er”. The reason the leaves are in bits is because they are leftover of pu’er’s roasting process, where pectin of the leaves is stuck together with small pieces of leaves. They were considered production waste before, and now revamped as a cool new thing with many health benefits and more intense flavor. It sounds to me that this could go either way.

Black - blacks are very tannic in nature - I would brew slightly stronger than you would for drinking plain, and pear with sweet fruits that are punchy in their taste. Strawberry comes to mind. No mineral tasting fruits like rock melon, and they must have strong tastes and smell, so watermelon for example is out.

Dark tea - don't pair dark tea with fruits. Shou puer is nearly milky in its taste sometimes, with the oils in the tea. It's much too dark of a flavour to pair.

Their sencha is almost frighteningly inexpensive, and the kicker is that they have free shipping (to the US at least) if you spend just $70 USD which is pretty crazy I think.

I've bought sencha from Harney and Sons and Yunomi. Harney Sencha was my introduction to sencha and generally tea as a whole. They have some nice stuff, but it's not the best price and some is drastically overpriced relative to what you can get elsewhere. Yunomi on the other hand specializes in Japanese green tea but shipping is so expensive. I paid about $50 alone in shipping and though I'm happy with all the sencha I've got, there's no way I'm trying anything besides Chikiriya for sencha on my next big order.

I put 5-6 bags of tazo Awake organic English breakfast in, leave it on the counter (with the bags in) for 30 minutes.

Oh you're asking about other teas. Lol.  

I think theres some significantly variable flavor even in the same type of tea.  My big thing is dong ding oolongs and even there some, if I didn't have it written on the bags, could confuse for a roasty Alishan oolong.

Recently I received some gift teas from my mom via Taiwanese family.  The Da Yu Ling  (1800m) and QingChunMing (1200m) are most reminiscent of shanlinxi oolong.  I *think* they're all that qingxin varietal which might be part of the similarity.  The  Qingming is a popular expensive tea because it's in the name, they harvest it at what I translate as the eve of spring.  It is the first bud and baby leaf the plants push out.   I don't know much about it though.  Qing ming can also be generically any first flush tea.  

The DaYuLing can also come from much higher, maybe 2500m my mom says.  Those teas grow more slowly because of the cold but get more flavor from the bright light.  I've never had any first flush tea from 2500m but if you wanted premium that might be up there. 

Had to check some pricing, about 75c a gram for what's available right now which looks to be winter-spring 2023.   If you wait a couple months the new stuff should be hitting the market and fresh winter tea is, as the kids say, fire no cap on God on God.",1,Hazmatspicyporkbuns,195zb8a,Brewing suggestions,12,16,image,"Does anyone have any digestions on how to brew this tea?

196dnkr,khzsg2s,"Aww, man, I've been there.. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but your tea is unfortunately ruined. Take it as an expensive lesson learned about storing your teas properly.

Tea will take on the smell of wherever it is stored. A zip-top bag will be your best friend when it comes to storing most teas. If you really want to store and age your teas properly, I recommend a clay pot with an airtight lid. Keep the same tea types together, and always store them in a dark place away from too much sunlight, moisture, and strong smells. 😉

So yeah. If you start telling people they aren't enjoying themselves properly, you're an ass.

And no, I deleted those comments because I regularly delete my history. I'm not a fan of reddit. I don't like the exploitation of reddit as a company so I don't like to add value. I tried to give it up last year, but the alternatives were... odd.

You do a good job of poorly summarizing your statement by leaving out what your actual point was and claiming you shouldnt brew certain teas gongfu style because.... .....the Chinese don't do it a lot. They do it certainly, but not a lot. And thats it. You provided nothing else other than I should listen to a linguist who said he won't put ice in wine even if he likes it more because others might judge him. Like, come on.

I was mistaken.

Edit: if you want to block, then block. But replying and blocking is stupid. I can't read what you said. But you clearly want to say something. I actually stopped myself from replying from you a lot because of how sensitive you are. You linked to another example  elsewhere that includes a comment where you complain about getting downvotes even though you have the highest vote count in the screenshot. I'm sorry you're sensitive, but you're just the other end of the spectrum of the same problem as OP. Just overly senstive to the point you think the entire community is out to get you. And keep in mind I ""continued"" the discussion you literally brought up. Pretending like defending myself is somehow poor behavior speaks to an immature mind. And the comment wasn't directly at you.

Totally fine to use one if you'd like, but it's not the kind of thing where you'll find fancy artisan pieces. Pretty much everyone is selling the same mass-produced ones from Taobao. I'd just add one to a tea order you're already making if the vendor already sells them, and don't spend too much money on it. 

Trays are kind of similar. I wouldn't buy a super expensive one because they tend to warp and get moldy over time.

We are what we eat and we eat what we have leeched into our environment.
And apparently most dark chocolate contains quite a bit of it. So good luck finding those few bars not containing any and it may also be batch depended.  Quite often cacao is just thrown on one big stack and when buying cacao it can come from anywhere.  Can try to buy organic, but that still comes from the same cacao pile. Just like with cotton or energy.

It is good chocolate though!  It also has implemented a supply chain tracker that actually traces their cacaobeans instead of buying from those giant random heaps of cacao.
And one of the few brands that is actually trying to change the cacao industry by helping the farmers with a fair price so they can produce cacao with better standards.

If i heat up some water in my kettle and put a few bags of tea (some reusable bags i can fill with loose leaf) and let the two bags brew over my commute (around 20 minutes) do you think that would be enough to get a good tea throughout the full 24 oz bottle? would it be too weak since 24 oz would normally take like 6 bags per the 1 bag per cup rule of thumb?   
Am i crazy for wanting mass quantities of tea?

195r8ba,khooerd,"Pros:   Very fast boil 7 minutes-ish. Faster then my residential induction cooktop and standard kettle. Preset buttons for the different brew types makes it fast yet again because theres no need to keep a cheat sheet around and adjust a dial. Fill with water, close lid, press the button and go. Pours really nice, doesn’t spill. Also doesn’t spill when its boiling because they engineered a splash guard inside the spout. Guage and light on the side that indicates water capacity.

Cons: the plug in base must be placed on a countertop preferably near a sink so if this is valuable real estate on your countertop it may add to clutter. During the brew cycle it does make the trademark “water boiling noise” off and on as it ramps up to temp but it will automatically stop making the noise when it reaches temp. I can’t think of any other cons it just does what you want fast and doesn’t spill boiling water everywhere so thats great. 

Desire: Only thing I wish it had was a simple timer on it but thats not a deal breaker really.

195kj9d,khnf9o9,"I just got into tea last year, but my understanding is that gongfu brewing allows you to taste different ""layers"" to the tea and each brew tastes quite different from the others. I'd say the first and last 2 brews of tea done gongfu style are usually less desirable (to me) than a western styled tea. But the middle brews are usually much richer in flavour. 

I believe that good leaves are the most important starting point, and that all tea can be brewed in a variety of ways and still be good. I brew gongfu when I have the time and mood. When I don't, I simply dump a small amount of  leaves into a cup and fill it with water, then drink it after 2-3 mins. Still better than Lipton or any teabag teas by a mile.",13,hkmckrbcm,195kj9d,Questions about gongfu-style brewing,2,13,,"From what I understand, it uses a high tea:water ratio and brew at much shorter intervals(20s, then 5s afterwards), for maybe 6-8 infusions.

Since I don't drink that much tea(if I brew 100ml for 6 times it'll be abit too much), I decided to use closer to 60ml.

That way I can brew 4 times before I go out.

But how is it different from normal western-style brewing? Since i'm actually just dumping all 4 infusions into the same travel mug.

I could drink each separately, but I have to go out.

While western brewing is an entire relationship, the combination of the best and the worst. Both of them great, but they are great in a different way.

Steeping time is not really an addition in this case, as 5 times 20 seconds steeping is not the same as a single steep for ~1.5 min. Oversteeping is rarely a case in gongfu brewing as certain compounds needs more time to dissolve than others (and different temperature). We call oversteeping when astringent and bitter compounds (catechins and caffeine) overpowers the liquid. That is the reason cup tasting is 5 minutes long brewing, to see the flaws of the tea.",5,tomknx,195kj9d,Questions about gongfu-style brewing,2,13,,"From what I understand, it uses a high tea:water ratio and brew at much shorter intervals(20s, then 5s afterwards), for maybe 6-8 infusions.

195kj9d,khnkrns,"A big part of gongfu brewing is tasting separate brews. The best analogy I've heard is to think of brewing tea as taking a trip: Western style is booking a train and getting straight to your destination, while gongfu is like taking a road trip and stopping in each town. Mixing all of the brews would be like taking a road trip without stopping - it's still all the work of driving yourself, but otherwise not far off from a train ride. 

While I do think tea is generally best brewed gongfu, it sounds like it might not fit your desires/needs. Some puerh stands up well to western or even grandpa style brewing, I've heard many people getting good results from shou puerh especially. 

Have you tried brewing your puerh western style? (I'm assuming you typically brew your other tea types that way).

19522ww,khkawsp,"Oh so i don't have the best opinion i work there 🌚
But still :
I think it's the best ""brand"" for origin teas, with solid supply chain and nice niche tea. They have really great teas, maybe a bit overpriced sometimes. But the classic ones Can be really good (this Year Long Jing Imperial is Amazing, and a perfect substitute  in my opinion to the Pre-qingming one)
For the flavoured tea...it depends ahah. 

Also it depends of the shop, some have a lot of newcomers still learning about tea. And you Can also find great independant tea shops :) 

As personal experience it's Amazing to work there because you can drink a lot of tea and have really high quality and mandatory formation.


To answer your question : not as fashionable as Kusmi, and more informed and specific than Mariage on origin teas (for example) and the teas are really good.
It's the best brand and that's why i decided to work there, but there is also amazing places.
And also that's a solid brand, with a non-changing base of good teas

1959ehf,khoz4bs,"Every family will have their own recipe and method, but this is how I do it.

1. Boil water (about 75% of the final volume of chai you want) and add the tea and spices.
2. Simmer for 3-5 mins. If you're patient you can simmer the spices for 10 minutes, and add the tea in the final 3 minutes. This draws out more flavour from the spices, but isn't necessary.
3. You should have a dark and fragrant concentrate at this point. Add whole milk (about 50% of the final volume of chai you want), bring up to a boil and simmer until satisfied with taste, texture and colour.
4. Add sweetener as desired and strain into cup.
5. Adjust steps until you nail your recipe. I haven't tried plant-based milks in chai but in my experience they are quite watery so as an example you might want to reduce the initial amount of water used or simmer for longer at the end.

I get the psychological side to it, but I'd be very surprised if you didn't prefer proper chai made by yourself with fresh, whole spices over a pre-made spice mix or instant chai powder.

1958a1y,khm94pd,"So, kinda like what people said, you can find a good one for not much, at thrift shops etc. I saw someone also suggested bartering your talents for a kettle, and that might be a good idea. But, for what you might pay for a sewing project, you might spend the same amount as a good kettle. I know that there's a difference between a kettle and a pot, so if you're just looking for something to boil the water I can recommend you what I have. As for steeping, I steep mine in a giant thermos, so you can use whatever.  Having a kettle is nice, because there's so much more that I use mine for than just tea. I like mine because it seems to be larger than most I saw, and I like to make a lot at the start of the day, then the thermos keeps it warm.  
This is mine:   
 But I really like this one: 

They're both a little more expensive that you might like, and definitely more than what you'd see at a thrift store, but you know, if you enjoy tea, and the process of making it, treat yourself. If I could make one last recommendation, avoid getting something that's polished stainless steel. I feel like mine constantly smudges, and since it doesn't have a thermometer on it, I try to use one of those laser thermometers. If you had something more opaque this works.

194lbqe,khgv3cm,"Brewed Gong Fu style. 4.5 g tea to 45ish ml water at 212 F. Gaiwan, cha hai, cup warmed. Tea steamed. 5 seconds, 10 s, 15 s, 20 s, 25 s, 30 s, 35 s, 40 s, 45 s, 50 s, 55 s, 1 minute, 1.5 m, 2 m, 3 m, 5 m, 10 m

Steamed leaves had aromas of rye crackers and plums.
Nose was reminiscent of lipstick and wax with something else underneath. That’s definitely different. It’s not unpleasant, but definitely not something I’ve encountered before in tea.

Palate matched the nose with some anise like sweetness. That sweetness flowed into the finish.
Silky thick mouthfeel. Very enjoyable.
Tea rounded over to have an interesting nature that was more anise and some flavor I couldn’t recognize.

Did 1st to last comparisons. 2nd infusion had that initial nose with additional note of fresh peas. 2nd to last was more rounded and no fresh peas note.
1st had even more pronounced fresh peas note, while last was more of the well rounded liquor like the 2nd to last.

I don’t know exactly what to make of this tea. It definitely had an enjoyable evolution and mouthfeel over the session, but there were definitely notes I couldn’t decipher. Like I’m missing a fruit or something in my mental aroma library.

That said many folks also enjoy green tea. My kindergarten class took a field trip to a cultural center where we participated in a green tea ceremony (although as a kindergartner I thought the tea tasted nasty and enjoyed the cookie that came with it far more). My mom liked to make genmaicha occasionally and that’s how I learned to appreciate tea in high school.

194qvkb,khjmjro,"Czar Nicholas II tea can be brewed just fine without a samovar, but I've fond that it does work a bit better with a samovar.  

You can mimic most of the samovar experience by brewing a batch of tea extra-strong with LOTS of leaf, pouring a little in your cup and then diluting it to taste with water from the kettle.  However what you can't do this way is the slow simmer of the tea concentrate that would occur in the chainik on top of the samovar body -- with teas like Czar Nicholas II I have found that this simmering takes away most of the sharpness of the lower-grade leaf in these blends and makes the result much more pleasant.

194jnre,khmj8n4,"Most decaf tea on the market is done with C02. Rarely they'll use ethyl acetate, and never swiss water method. Decaffeinating strips the leaf of more than just caffeine and usually results in a weaker brew across the board.

My body can't handle caffeine the same way it used to, so I'm looking into decaf options. 

Looking into methods it seems CO2 is the 'gold standard' for decaf that preserves as much of the flavour and goodness as well as not leaving residual nasties from heavy chemicals. 

I see the water method mentioned, which seems to be what I'm seeing to be similar to the Swiss water method used a lot in the US for coffee (why not here!?) and results in a decaf but weaker taste etc.

Clipper organic decaf used CO2 comes up but their reviews are pretty damning, largely talking of how weak they are, how even 2-3 bags isn't decent often. 

Taylors of Harrogate seems to mention both water and CO2, with much better cost more.

Both of those are breakfast tea style. It'd be nice to have at least an earl grey style and stronger one if not more. 

Sigh, so much more expensive and you have to worry about how they removed the caffeine if you don't mind just grabbing a supermarket decaf option. 

Here methylene chloride seems to be the method of choice for 99% and how the brand's handle it seems to differ too, many saying conflicting things - very little is left so there's no issue, any left over evaporates when drying, any left over evaporates in the cup (that's the most confusing, wouldn't it just be released into the tea, which we don't want). Many countries don't even allow imports of tea with it in and was shocked we are behind there, much like with the water decaf methods for coffee that are common in the states - here that's craft or specialty coffee!",pickingparts,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/194jnre/decaf_teas_that_uses_the_co2_or_water_method/,0,1

Assume if I fill that up (with enough room for leaves to expand) and play with steep times (due to the higher volume of water) it may give me some kind of middle ground between grandpa style where I can enjoy it all day and gongfu where I can use some of the other types of leaves.",1,tazguy79,1947fu0,Travel tea,5,33,,"Just looking for advice/insight. I am a long time fan of tea, but never ventured outside of tea bags. I'm liable to just grab my big 32 oz thermos of hot water and drop 3 tea bags in it and let them steep until I get to work (10 minutes or so) and just sip on one or two of those all day (is 64 oz of tea a day too much?).

I have recently been interested in getting in to trying better tea. I think I am most interested in brewing gonfu style, but maybe grandpa style is a better fit for me.

With that background I am wondering what kinds of options there are for someone who doesn't usually have time to sit and go through the ritual day to day. In an ideal world it would be something I could do at work. I have seen some thermoses on amazon that have a tea infuser on the top. You keep your leaves on top and turn the whole thing upside down to infuse. When you turn it back up all the water drains back in to the thermos. Would this be close enough to gonfu style to be an improvement over my current tea bags? If I did this method are the leaves OK to be in there all day and resteeped if more water is added to the thermos?

What other methods do you use for ""office"" tea?

194htwb,khgy4ol,"I've seen that on older kettles on the bottom, less so on the sides.

If you can feel a pit with a toothpick or needle or something, it's probably a manufacturing defect.  They stretch these vessels from a smaller shape and tiny problems in the ingot they work from can get blown up by the stretching process.

Would probably recommend returning it for a new one if they are pits.  I don't think they're harmful but they will slowly get worse with time especially if you do like I do always have water in the kettle.

194htwb,khgz4ws,"Not rust, and do you see all the other dots around it in a half circle shape?  There is a coiled heating element under this half circle so this arc of metal gets hotter than the rest.  Typically, as long as you keep a minimum amount of water when heating it up, the dots remain hardly noticable, but if you boil with very little water or let it dry out they will become darker and also naturally get darker over time.  And they aren't hard water deposits because you cannot clean these dots away.  They result from the temperature differential of being near the heating coil.  Some kettles use a larger coil mounted farther away from the bottom to avoid this effect.  Ultimately these spots are harmless and just a minor blemish that may darker a little over time, but cannot be cleaned out via minor scrubbing, citric acid, vinegar, bleach, or any other chemical people sometimes suggest to remove them.

193wlxp,khc6rfi,"Regardless of the tea you're drinking you can always reduce the time or the temperature.

Tea bags are designed for really quick infusion and as a result they can go bitter really quick.

Try with a cup of plain hot water.  If it's freshly boiled, let it sit for 30 seconds or a minute then dunk in the bag for 30 seconds and test a sip.  Use a spoon if it's too hot.   If it's not bitter, go for another 30 seconds and try again. In the end, count up all the time and you should have a good ballpark time to dial in. Don't be afraid to experiment.

Some cheap teas can also just be loaded with so many tannins that it is somewhat unavoidable.

You could also try cold brewing.  I do this sometimes.   You might miss out on some of the finer notes but hey it's bag tea,  I don't need to tell you to not to expect too much in the first place.  Same water to bag ratio to start and just chuck it in the fridge overnight.  Usually if I do this I make a big pitcher and then maybe you might want add an extra tea bag for every three or something.",11,Hazmatspicyporkbuns,193wlxp,Tea newb,5,18,,"I enjoy drinking tea but my problem lies in steeping my own tea. I don’t have specialty tea and just the tea bags commonly bought from the grocery.

193wlxp,khcber0,"To be honest though...sometimes stuff  just tastes better when someone else makes it. 

But if you're not used to steeping your own tea and seem to only like it from tea houses and cafes...that's probably because they are using the appropriate (or at least *different*) water temperatures and steep times. 

If you don't have a kettle with temp controls, it can be pretty tricky to get it right.  Generally, white and green teas require the lowest temperature and shortest steep time. About 185° F for 1-2 minutes. Anything hotter/longer and your brew will likely be very bitter and the delicate tasting notes quite literally burnt off.

Oolongs can be steeped at 195° F for 2-3 minutes before becoming bitter. 

And black teas and herbals hold their integrity just fine in 200+° F for anywhere between 2-5 min depending on how strong you like your brew. 

Also keep in mind that not all teas are the same! You can have two black teas that seem in all respects the same to each other but are vastly different once brewed. Same for any type of tea. Even the generic stuff can be night and day to each other. 

I'd say your first step to steeping a tea you like is finding out what teas you've been being served. Maybe all the cafes have been serving you dancon oolongs but you keep buying taiguanyin oolongs. 

And lastly, don't worry about how you want to doctor up your tea to make it palatable. Cream, sugar, honey, spices....who cares. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Tea is a gift. It doesn't matter so much how it is enjoyed as long as it *is* enjoyed.",7,TeacupCat21,193wlxp,Tea newb,5,18,,"I enjoy drinking tea but my problem lies in steeping my own tea.

For enhancing the flavour? How do you brew? If you take regular teabags going whole leaf will do much. If you brew western style going gong fu cha can improve a lot of teas.

I always drank japanese green tea, but I really got into tea drinking after I watched some videos from Wu Mountain Tea  and I was super fascinated by the way that tea is produced and the fact, that it all comes from the same plant basically.

I usually let the tea infused a bit longer than is recommended in instructions with the recommended temperature.

I also wanted to try some of the green teas, seems like one of the most known and recognised is chinese Sencha.

The problem I have.. I really do want to enjoy the teas (every time I prepare some it feels so homey and one could even say ceremonial) but it is really difficult for me to taste anything. With the smoked Lapsang I was at least quite intrigued with the strong (and weird) smell and could get close to some taste.

I usually let the tea infused a bit longer than is recommended in instructions with the recommended temperature.

How can I enhance the taste of teas? Wouldn't a sweetener ruin the original taste? Or what teas should I try next?
Or am I just doomed and my taste buds are burned out/used to strong tastes?

PS- to complement the tea related tasting experience- in the past I enjoyed some of the rooibos, will have to try some again. I enjoy very much an Indian chai (the tea taste there is kind of in the background compared to all the spices milk etc)",Critical_Cattle_6857,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/193yjf4/teas_with_strong_taste/,0,1

193advp,kh82ypt,"Nakamura Tokichi is probably the most popular fancy tea brand in Uji. Their café often has several hours of wait time (main branch in Uji that is, they also have smaller cafés in Tokyo and Kyoto) but they have a nice selection of tea types in their store and often freshly brewed teas to try. I personally love their Houjicha, but every Japanese person I have served their Genmaicha talked endlessly about how good that one was. 

Ippodo is Kyoto's most famous old tea store and somewhere a lot of Japanese people go to buy fancy gifts for family. Their historical main store was just renovated (it re-opened in December), so it's definitely worth a visit but unfortunately also likely crowded. 

Fukujuen is another favourite of mine! Both their Sencha and 緑茶 (lit. green tea, used for any ungraded green teas) were of surprisingly high quality. Fukujuen also has the best English language website and they advertise tea experiences specifically for foreigners, so if you are unsure where to start, that one would be my recommendation. Fukujuen also has their main branch in Kyoto but they have stores all over the country. The flagship store also sells a lot of tea wares, not sure about the other branches.

Traditional tea stores in Japan don't really sell black tea. Lupicia is a Hokkaido shop specialised in ""Western"" teas, which mostly means lots of flavoured black teas, some Oolongs and a few hand selected Uji-chas. They do however, also have a large selection of unflavoured teas, especially when new harvests come in and they have a variety of cute tea tins for collecting. The store in Kyoto (Teramachi-dori) is bigger than the stores in Osaka. Never been to one in Tokyo, so I can't say how those are. 
The biggest advantage of Lupicia is that they have open samples, so you can at least smell the teas. That's not always standard with tea shops in Japan.

As far as teas go:

グリンティー (literally the english word green tea) cheapest green tea, mixed with sugar, aimed at children. Be careful about asking for green teas in store, because they might think you are looking for this.

緑茶 (ryoku-cha, green tea) the Japanese word for green tea, usually used for ungraded green tea, because if it was something special they would write that instead. Cheap, daily-use tea that the average Japanese person drinks like water.

番茶 (Bancha) lower grade of green tea, similar to Sencha but cheaper.

煎茶 (Sencha) sencha, second most famous Japanese type of tea after matcha. theoretically, the main difference between matcha and sencha is that matcha get's turned into a powder. But the money is where the matcha is, so sencha tend to use slightly less high quality leaves. 

抹茶 (Matcha) powdered green tea. comes in a variety of grades/price ranges. You can totally make matcha latte out of high quality matcha but that's just throwing money out of the window. Milk masks a lot of the subtler flavour differences of high grade matcha, so get the cheap stuff from the supermarket for that.

玉露 (Gyokuro) highest grade of Japanese green tea. Said to be less bitter to mildly sweet but what different producers sell as Gyokuro varies wildly. If you buy one, see if you can order a cup to try at their store first to see if you like it, because it is usually capital E Expensive.

ほうじ茶/焙じ茶 (Houjicha, lit. roasted green tea) roasted green tea, popular for it's smokey flavour and lesser caffein content. Also sold in powdered form for lattes. While popular in Kyoto/Uji, it is probably the only tea famous in Japan for a different region. Kaga-Kuki-cha is a famous produce of the Ishikawa prefecture and quality label like Uji-cha.

(Uji-cha is any tea grown in Uji, Kyoto prefecture. It is said to be Japan's highest quality tea, so many advertise teas only as Uji-cha)

くき茶 (Kuki-cha, aka stem tea) Kuki-cha is any tea that uses stems instead of leaves. Theoretically all teas could be made as kuki-cha, but typically kuki-chas are a variety of houjicha. Houjicha already has low levels of caffein, but kuki-houjicha has even less. 

玄米茶 (Genmaicha, brown rice tea) usually a type of green tea (often sencha) mixed with roasted brown rice. Sometimes mixed with matcha powder, popular tea to serve with meals.

麦茶 (Mugicha, barley tea) typically made from only roasted barley, without any green tea in it. Often served cold on summer, popular at traditional noodles shops.

黒豆茶 (kuromamecha, black soybean tea) made from black soybeans. sometimes in pure form, sometimes soybeans get mixed in with green teas. Hokkaido is famous for kuromamecha. Beans are a symbol of longlevity in Japan, so you often see this tea pop up around new year. Also sold in powdered form, but the powdered one often has sugar mixed in.

昆布茶/こんぶ茶 (Kombu-cha, no not that one, lit. seaweed tea) Kombu-cha (sometimes wrongly written as Konbu-cha to differentiate it from the western fermented drink) is a tea made from seaweed. No really. Often flavoured with Japanese plums (ume), it basically tastes like soup. Good choice for Cha-tsuke, a dish where you poor tea over left-over rice. Basically nature's sport drink.

193pcof,khb1ys4,"When my coworkers were getting off coffee onto tea, I started them out with Yamamoto Hojicha tea bags (available on Amazon). It’s a roasted green tea, nutty-tasting. From there, they branched out on their own tea journeys. 

I used to be a daily coffee drinker - not 8-10
cups, but enough that if I skipped a day I would feel it hard the next day. I switched back to tea during the early pandemic and it went smoothly. No caffeine headaches at all and now I could skip a couple of days and still not get a headache. 

Personally, I’m a loose leaf kinda gal (for the most part - I do enjoy a builder’s tea with milk and sugar). I find teabags too expensive for what you get. You can buy your own teabags to fill with looseleaf and it would still be cheaper than buying teabags direct.

Also some advice, don't start off by buying a whole teapot. Just get a lil strainer/infuser for your mug, or use teabags. And while you don't need to buy super expensive tea to get a good cup, going to a tea shop instead of your supermarket will probably yield much better results.

Both coffee and tea contain a huge amount of health benefits, mostly thanks to their antioxidants. Coffee contains more caffeine than tea, so you have to be careful of that. No caffeine in the afternoon, people!! There are also a lot of herbal 'teas' with no caffeine at all, which I think is another plus!!

193f9jc,khamqq9,"Spectacular Yiwu for $0.40/g is a lot to ask for. 

I've enjoyed the teas I've had from Yiwu Mouontain Tea.  His single estate teas are more than what you're looking to spend, but he has some Yiwu blends that are more affordable and still quite tasty. They're processed less green than the usual Farmerleaf style and may be more to your liking. The early spring cake is less astringent and more fragrant than the typical young Farmerleaf. Yiwu Mountain Tea also has a deeper selection, with cakes that already have a few years of age on them.

FWIW, Farmerleaf is my goto for young sheng. I like their house style, so maybe take my suggestion with a grain of salt. Nonetheless I do think YMT has good Yiwu tea with a different house style. I think it's be hard to go wrong trying one of his lucky dip samplers and seeing what you think.

Instead, a nice somewhat larger porcelain or glass pot might be nicer.

The fun thing about tea services is how long they've been made for. You can get almost anything you want from eBay or Etsy for not very much (especially during recessions, I got my Wedgwood during the last one). 

New or used, they can be pretty affordable. I like to buy local and there are a ton of folks who will make tea pots. As long as the whole thing is glazed, you can't really go wrong (provided you don't drop it).

1935eur,kh6y9q3,"There're some  methods to prepare either of them. I'd say that you would rather brew sencha diffrently than gyokuro  in general.


In case of both you might use simmilar amount of leaves (5-6g/100ml will be very good, though of course you may use more for even more concentrated beverage, here shiboridashi works pretty well as it's often very small [I have one with 40ml] so it's easy to adjust the way you want it to be concentrated, thought in my opinion for standard sencha kyusu would be more suitable) you can use simmilar amount of leaves.  

In case of brewing temperature, in sencha I would reccomend anything between 60 and 80°C (typically the higher quality sencha will be suitable with lower temperatures), and in case of gyokuro  45-60.


In case of brewing, in case of sencha I'd recommend  trying out  first brewing for 1 minute, and in case of gyokuro I have at least two  methods of brewing to consider,   one would be  to   make a first brew using the water as above for two minutes.  The second one:  Let gyokuro sit in a room temperature water for 14 minutes. Give a try to both methods.

Of course you might adjust some  aspects like time, tea/volume ratio, temperature etc. to your needs but the methods above might be a good starting point.",3,I__Antares__I,1935eur,Sencha and Gyokuro,6,4,,I have a question about the difference between brewing sencha and gyokuro.

192yzd2,kh5s8vp,"Brewed Gong Fu style. 4.5 g tea to 45ish ml water at 212 F. Gaiwan, cha hai, cup warmed. Tea steamed. 5 seconds, 10 s, 15 s, 20 s, 25 s, 30 s, 35 s, 40 s, 45 s, 1 minute, 1.5 m, 2 m, 3 m, 5 m, 10 m

Steamed leaves had aromas of raspberries.
Maple syrup and malt on the nose with hints of stone fruits.
Malt and briskness on the palate.
Silky mouthfeel.
Apricots and cherries on the finish.

Fruit notes on palate took over as malt rounded over during the session, which was a nice evolution.

This tea’s flavors were definitely on the thin side of things which kept it from greatness.

Did 1st to last comparisons. 2nd infusion was very plum and raspberry on the nose, with dark chocolate on the palate, and that fruit finish, while 2nd to last was light nose, rounded palate, and light sweetness on the finish. 1st infusion was a lighter version of the 2nd, while last was almost out of gas.

I really feel like this tea was a near miss from being stellar. It had all the right flavors and evolution, it just wasn’t quite there in terms of overall presentation. At around $.50 per gram it’s an ok value if you want to give it a try.

Unfortunately, I can't think of good tea suggestion that would compare to what you're asking for.  Whenever a coffee drinker asks for tea suggestions I always tell them to give yerba mate, roasted hojicha, and *lapsang souchong a try. 

However, I do have *general* tea suggestions. 

My personal favorite teas are:

'Timberline Morning' from the company Chariteas.
I've posted about this tea and the company before. My veins are half full of blood and half full of this tea. It's got a woody, chocolate-and-honey thing going on. 

'Red Buffalo' (also from Chariteas). It's a rolled oolong from Vietnam that has a toasty/apricoty quality. It makes a *beautiful* amber colored brew. 

'Dark Forest' from the company Bitterleaf Teas. Unfortunately I don't think they will ever restock. Which is truly a shame because it was so good! It tasted like dark chocolate and deep red cherries. 


*If you've never had lapsang before, it tastes exactly like a campfire smells. Back when I waitressed in a tea house I was briefly put in charge of baking the scones while the head baker was on a work trip. For the month of July I made the tea of the month Lapsang Souchong and I paired it with a s'more scone (my own recipe!).

With black tea, I love their Yeshing Gushu Hongcha and Swerve (roasted black). I also like their lapsang and some of their other loose black teas like daily Jin Jun Mei.

I'm new to japanese tea drinking and the first one a tried was a gyokuro (20€ per 100g). I tried a LOT of different combinations of concentration, temp and time, but never got a satisfying result.

So I tried:

2g per 200mL - 70°C for 180s (label instructions, best result: A liiittle bit sweet but quite bitter (or umami?))

5g per 200mL - 50°C for 180s (not sweet and less bitter)

7g per 200mL - 65°C for 150s (very bitter and very unpleasant)

10g per 200mL - 70°C for 30s (boring and a bit bitter)

The water quality is apparently 7,8 dh in my area, which is not too bad, I guess. I used a kyusu (200mL, dark clay), boiled the water in a pot let it cool down and checked the temp with a meat thermometer.

192xtdw,kh6qe7g,"I agree that it seems a little too cheap to be good Gyokuro. For 20€/100g you can get really good Sencha which will be a better experience than bad Gyokuro.  

To still get something out of it, keep in mind:

- Adding more tea (to water ratio) intensifies the taste that you have. So if you had something that was nice but weak, just add more leaves next time.
- Based on your tests, it turns bitter quickly, so focus on tests with 50-60°C from now on. Hint: It is possible that your temperature measurement is not completely correct and that it reads lower than what it is. For example when your meat thermometer is just halfway submerged.
- Umami is not the same as bitterness. So if it really is very bitter, that´s not what it should be.
- Gyokuro can also be brewed like a Sencha. Gyokuro has just the advantage to work with even lower temperature and longer steeping time very well. So maybe try 60°C for a minute if you haven´t already (amount of leaf is not that important just for testing the bitterness, so go with like 5g for your cup).

The sweetness can be quite different between different qualities and cultivars, so maybe this one is just not for you (or even objectively bad). I´d recommend to try smaller samples of more expensive Gyokuro just to know how they can be.

Where did you get yours? And where do you live? Maybe someone has a recommendation on where to go to get something good.

2g per 200mL - 70°C for 180s (label instructions, best result: A liiittle bit sweet but quite bitter (or umami?))

5g per 200mL - 50°C for 180s (not sweet and less bitter)

7g per 200mL - 65°C for 150s (very bitter and very unpleasant)

10g per 200mL - 70°C for 30s (boring and a bit bitter)

.....etc.

The water quality is apparently 7,8 dh in my area, which is not too bad, I guess. I used a kyusu (200mL, dark clay), boiled the water in a pot let it cool down and checked the temp with a meat thermometer.

Is gyokuro just not my cup of tea? ...or is the quality bad maybe? the leaves are dark green and there are some long leaves but also a lot of broken up ones. I hope someone can give some advice.

Fermented tea like pu’er. These are fermented for long periods of time (like alcohol except it’s just the leaves). They tend to have strong, interesting flavors. Can be somewhat intimidating for the uninitiated due to sheer variety, price range, the way it comes in bricks, etc. 

Most approachable option—cheap tea. Sometime like an Assam CTC, or a cheap bagged tea is going to give you strong cup of tea that brews quickly. Not very subtle, but strong.

First cour of steeps reveal a Blang dominant presentation that has a little bit of bite and back of tongue bitterness, but slightly dulled by aging so as to be reasonably approachable. Some storage note (dry) appreciable but it's quite light. 

There is reasonable transformation over many steeps as Millstone has decent longevity, and the pleasant bitterness lasts until steep 6 or so, before the tea truely rounds out and sweetens a little. 

There is a promise of stonefruit towards the end, yet this is not fully realized, and after the tenth steep the leaves empty out rapidly and the tailend is a bit bland. 

Millstone unfortunately is a bit lacking in aroma (nose & mouth) and also has an unremarkable mouthfeel. Huigan is not well developed. 

Overall, Millstone offers a glimpse into both fresh and aged Blang but isn't we developed in either presentation. It doesn't excel in any particular aspect, and represents a fairly middling Blang blend. I wouldn't chose this over factory cabbage or peacock cakes.

Tea is much cheaper there and you get to see awesome things with awesome food.,53,moveoolong,19266dh,I spent $2000 on tea this holiday season. I aimed for mid to high shelf items ($0.22-1 per gram) here’s my favorites:,42,50,,"
-Fruit bomb lapsang from W2T
It offers a juicy mouthfeel full of stone fruit and berries when gently gongfu brewed (85 Celsius, 1g per 20ml water with 40-60 sec infusions) with a clean, arousing energy and a bouquet of pumpkin spice, yams, and stone fruit. If you turn up the heat or infusion times you’ll render the tea more like a cup after cup of sweet potato pie in a cup instead. 

-2014 Wu Liang ""Sweet and Thick"" Ripe Pu-erh from Yunnan Sourcing 
This is a great example of a red date and lotus puerh with no bitterness or cook funk and 10+ rich infusions for a great price. This is easy to brew, forgiving if you’re not paying attention, delicious either way and hard to beat the price. 

-Caopingtou Natural Farming ""Ruby Belle"" Oriental Beauty Oolong Tea - Spring 2023 also from Yunnan Sourcing 
This is such a deliciously complex tea, reminds me much more of a Zhen Shan xiao zhong red tea than an oolong, but it is relatively delicate to brew, as are many oriental beauty productions. This tea takes the drinker through multiple cascading 
 waves of flavor and aroma that are all equally represented in an experience that hits everyone with the gnosis that this is one damn good tea. 

-hidden peaks tea’s unblended brick shou is such a balanced shou with an energy that can only be described as zen af 
However it’s $0.70-0.80 per gram sooooo save up for some if you love balanced, enchanting shou tea that blends dates, wood, and lotus all together in an agar wood incense miasma. 


-2016 Menghai ""Golden Fruit"" Ripe Pu-erh also from Yunnan sourcing is kinda amazing because it’s rare that a tea designed to taste and smell fruity actually taste and smell fruity in a balanced manner that has great qualities across the board and isn’t just good for one peak infusion and smells kinda like its namesake. This tea tastes and smells peachy in the most shou puerh way possible without being bad at all. It’s also super cheap and kicks the crap out of most of the “daily drinker” teas I’ve tried from Yunnan sourcing and w2t. 


-Ceylon Silver Needle White from WhatCha 
Is the best white tea I’ve tried this year and also the best silver needle I’ve tried compared to those from Yunnan sourcing and white 2 tea alike. 
It’s light, but notably sweet and fruity with a floral honey aroma and legs for days at 9-10 infusions. Where other white teas prove inflexible, this tea will perform well at almost any brew style I’ve tried, throw some in a pot and put water 85 c and up and you’ll be satisfied.

It offers a juicy mouthfeel full of stone fruit and berries when gently gongfu brewed (85 Celsius, 1g per 20ml water with 40-60 sec infusions) with a clean, arousing energy and a bouquet of pumpkin spice, yams, and stone fruit. If you turn up the heat or infusion times you’ll render the tea more like a cup after cup of sweet potato pie in a cup instead. 

-2014 Wu Liang ""Sweet and Thick"" Ripe Pu-erh from Yunnan Sourcing 
This is a great example of a red date and lotus puerh with no bitterness or cook funk and 10+ rich infusions for a great price. This is easy to brew, forgiving if you’re not paying attention, delicious either way and hard to beat the price. 

-Caopingtou Natural Farming ""Ruby Belle"" Oriental Beauty Oolong Tea - Spring 2023 also from Yunnan Sourcing 
This is such a deliciously complex tea, reminds me much more of a Zhen Shan xiao zhong red tea than an oolong, but it is relatively delicate to brew, as are many oriental beauty productions. This tea takes the drinker through multiple cascading 
 waves of flavor and aroma that are all equally represented in an experience that hits everyone with the gnosis that this is one damn good tea.

191m27z,kgxfv82,Did the guy just write a whole article on the ritual of putting a teabag in a pot?,56,Ayywa,191m27z,Brew tea like an Englishman,181,65,,"I have the following Reddit post written by a Jerry Kelly (no idea who this is) saved in my notes. I’ve cherished it all these years, and I share it with yall expecting it will provide equal satisfaction.

Brew tea like an Englishmen

On boiling the water

Cold water. Boil it once. Pour immediately into a teapot (If you are making tea for just yourself a mug is acceptable) Left over water in the kettle from last time? Throw that shit away.

On Teapots

This is never cleaned.

•	⁠Your friend thinks it would be a great idea to make cocktails in it? Throw it away.
•	⁠Sick in it? Throw it away
•	⁠Cleaned with anything other than just hot water? Throw it away. Your teapot should have a tea cosy, it is frowned upon if this is not chequered or floral. Bonus points if it matches your tea towels. Regarding the tea cosy: it is entirely acceptable, if not required, that you put it on your head and refer yourself as the Bishop. (Thanks to iamtheparty) As pointed out 'warming the pot' is a common practice whereby a small amount of boiled water is added to the tea prior to the teabags and swirled around. This is to make sure the tea is piping hot. In my opinion this is not strictly necessary but comes under the banner of 'cocking about'.

On Mugs

Teacups and saucers are only used to impress people that you do not want to come to your house. Use a mug. Mugs should be large, clean and most importantly yours * Not your Dad's * Not one that you found at the back of the cupboard at your office kitchen, even if it is the only one that does not smell like off milk. * It must be your own mug. There are many like it but this one is yours. You do not use it at 3am when you feel the need for bathroom tap water. You do not use it to keep your stationary in. You do not permit anyone else to use it. This mug is for tea and tea alone.

On Brands of Tea

Most people have a preference to which tea brand they like. Personally I'm a big fan of Yorkshire tea. PG tips, in my opinion, are of the devil. If someone were to hand me a cup of it, I would drink it. I'm British anything else would be impolite. We will cover etiquette later. Students Red label tea from Sainsbury's is fantastic for its cost. On Tea Leaves Some people have got the time to make loose leaf tea. Well done you. How was art school? I also like loose leaf tea. I drink it when I have nothing better to do or am at a tea shop and have the leisure time to deal with loose leaf. On the whole though, teabags will suffice. Yes they will. Stop it.

On Brewing

One teabag per person and one for the pot. Do not deviate from this method. You do not know better. Again taste varies for the strength of your tea. It is vital, VITAL that you do not over brew the tea. Some of the naturally stronger teas like Yorkshire should not be brewed for long as they will become bitter.

•	⁠Don't go and have a piss.

•	⁠Don't go and chat up that lovely bird in Finance.

•	⁠Don't play Angry Birds.

•	⁠STAY. THE. FUCK. THERE. If you have used a teapot, after a minute use a spoon to stir a few times. Brewing time should be around 4 minutes. Pour a little out into your mug to check the strength. If it is the colour of a dark ale such as Otter then the tea is at a good strength. If you have used a mug stirring regularly is fine. A good indicator of when your tea has reached a good strength is that you can only see the top 1/2 inch of the teabag due to the darkness of your beverage.

On Milk

People vary in their taste for strong tea. While brewing strength is important milk will also lower the strength of your tea. Add it slowly, preferably from a small jug rather than from an ungainly 6 pint milk bottle. You do not want to make a mess, that would be unseemly. Some people say that you must add milk first before adding tea. Some people also believe that pluto isn't a planet. Fuck those people. I have found that it makes very little difference. Much in the same way that if you were dropped into hot liquid you would scream the same amount as if you had boiling liquid poured onto you.

On Sugar

This component is widely debated. Some will take enough sugar to cause diabetes within a two mile radius. The great undecided populous will take somewhere between the most infuriating of measures (just a little bit) and what they call 3 teaspoons, which, due to the ever changing laws of science could mean practically any amount. Those enlightened few will ask for no sugar. This, apart from being a lot easier to measure, is also the most refreshing way to enjoy tea. I have yet to come across anyone who drinks tea with sugar to be anything less than abhorrent. Of course I say all this in jest. Drink tea as you like it. I would encourage you to try it without sugar for one week. If you remain stoically unaffected then you may return to your faux tea with my faux blessing. There is an exception. If someone has just heard some distressing news (like their aunt has just been severely injured by a swan), then sweet tea is the most appropriate prescription. Also, if you are an OAP, you are allowed to drink tea as sweet as you like with complete impunity. (Thanks Anon_is_a_Meme)

On Biscuits

Digestives or hobnobs. Rich teas are a sick joke and are a trap for those of you who dunk biscuits in your tea. If you must have chocolate coated biscuits then choose a dark chocolate variety, these will leave less chocolate on your fingers.

On Etiquette

•	⁠Tea is a social drink, before you make it enquire as to whether anyone else would like one in the vicinity.

•	⁠Drink at your leisure, coffee is for abusing when deadlines approach

•	⁠Biscuits should be served on a side plate

•	⁠If you make any mess while making tea clear up after yourself

•	⁠It is always best to throw any boiled water and any unused tea away after using the kettle and teapot

-Pour boiling water and steep for 5 minutes

-Pour into teacup through strainer (always teacups and saucers, I’m not one for drinking from beakers)

People vary in their taste for strong tea. While brewing strength is important milk will also lower the strength of your tea. Add it slowly, preferably from a small jug rather than from an ungainly 6 pint milk bottle. You do not want to make a mess, that would be unseemly. Some people say that you must add milk first before adding tea. Some people also believe that pluto isn't a planet. Fuck those people. I have found that it makes very little difference. Much in the same way that if you were dropped into hot liquid you would scream the same amount as if you had boiling liquid poured onto you.

On Sugar

This component is widely debated. Some will take enough sugar to cause diabetes within a two mile radius. The great undecided populous will take somewhere between the most infuriating of measures (just a little bit) and what they call 3 teaspoons, which, due to the ever changing laws of science could mean practically any amount. Those enlightened few will ask for no sugar. This, apart from being a lot easier to measure, is also the most refreshing way to enjoy tea. I have yet to come across anyone who drinks tea with sugar to be anything less than abhorrent. Of course I say all this in jest. Drink tea as you like it. I would encourage you to try it without sugar for one week. If you remain stoically unaffected then you may return to your faux tea with my faux blessing. There is an exception. If someone has just heard some distressing news (like their aunt has just been severely injured by a swan), then sweet tea is the most appropriate prescription. Also, if you are an OAP, you are allowed to drink tea as sweet as you like with complete impunity. (Thanks Anon_is_a_Meme)

Brew tea like an Englishmen

On boiling the water

Cold water. Boil it once. Pour immediately into a teapot (If you are making tea for just yourself a mug is acceptable) Left over water in the kettle from last time? Throw that shit away.

On Teapots

This is never cleaned.

•	⁠Your friend thinks it would be a great idea to make cocktails in it? Throw it away.
•	⁠Sick in it? Throw it away
•	⁠Cleaned with anything other than just hot water? Throw it away. Your teapot should have a tea cosy, it is frowned upon if this is not chequered or floral. Bonus points if it matches your tea towels. Regarding the tea cosy: it is entirely acceptable, if not required, that you put it on your head and refer yourself as the Bishop. (Thanks to iamtheparty) As pointed out 'warming the pot' is a common practice whereby a small amount of boiled water is added to the tea prior to the teabags and swirled around. This is to make sure the tea is piping hot. In my opinion this is not strictly necessary but comes under the banner of 'cocking about'.

On Mugs

Teacups and saucers are only used to impress people that you do not want to come to your house. Use a mug. Mugs should be large, clean and most importantly yours * Not your Dad's * Not one that you found at the back of the cupboard at your office kitchen, even if it is the only one that does not smell like off milk. * It must be your own mug. There are many like it but this one is yours. You do not use it at 3am when you feel the need for bathroom tap water. You do not use it to keep your stationary in. You do not permit anyone else to use it. This mug is for tea and tea alone.

On Brands of Tea

Most people have a preference to which tea brand they like. Personally I'm a big fan of Yorkshire tea. PG tips, in my opinion, are of the devil. If someone were to hand me a cup of it, I would drink it. I'm British anything else would be impolite. We will cover etiquette later. Students Red label tea from Sainsbury's is fantastic for its cost. On Tea Leaves Some people have got the time to make loose leaf tea. Well done you. How was art school? I also like loose leaf tea. I drink it when I have nothing better to do or am at a tea shop and have the leisure time to deal with loose leaf. On the whole though, teabags will suffice. Yes they will. Stop it.

On Brewing

One teabag per person and one for the pot. Do not deviate from this method. You do not know better. Again taste varies for the strength of your tea. It is vital, VITAL that you do not over brew the tea. Some of the naturally stronger teas like Yorkshire should not be brewed for long as they will become bitter.

•	⁠Don't go and have a piss.

•	⁠Don't go and chat up that lovely bird in Finance.

•	⁠Don't play Angry Birds.

•	⁠STAY. THE. FUCK. THERE. If you have used a teapot, after a minute use a spoon to stir a few times. Brewing time should be around 4 minutes. Pour a little out into your mug to check the strength.

191m27z,kgxxyqv,"The point (that was made somewhat jokingly, I assume) still stands, that english people are bad at making tea. But aside from that, tea is not even produced in the uk. Most black tea drunk in the west is produced in india. Tea was brought to india from china by the brits, only they obviously didn't bring any of the nuances of tea production with them. 
This is going to sound condescending af but
What exactly am I to learn from dunking teabags, which contain a cheap, mass produced knock off, in hot water for a few minutes? Not to mention that the variety of tea represented in western tea culture doesn't even account for a fraction of the styles produced in china and it's surrounding countries.
Lastly, calling tea a dish is a stretch. It's half agricultural, half artisinal product. People like to make a big deal of brewing it, but the real skill and knowledge involved is demonstrated by the farmers and producers. Brits and other westerners, including me, don't really have anything to share on that front, it's just on us to appreciate.


In short: western teaculture, for all it has stripped away, has not added anything of value for me to consider it worthwhile learning from.",-5,Potatow-Edge,191m27z,Brew tea like an Englishman,181,65,,"I have the following Reddit post written by a Jerry Kelly (no idea who this is) saved in my notes.

Much in the same way that if you were dropped into hot liquid you would scream the same amount as if you had boiling liquid poured onto you.

On Sugar

This component is widely debated. Some will take enough sugar to cause diabetes within a two mile radius. The great undecided populous will take somewhere between the most infuriating of measures (just a little bit) and what they call 3 teaspoons, which, due to the ever changing laws of science could mean practically any amount. Those enlightened few will ask for no sugar. This, apart from being a lot easier to measure, is also the most refreshing way to enjoy tea. I have yet to come across anyone who drinks tea with sugar to be anything less than abhorrent. Of course I say all this in jest. Drink tea as you like it. I would encourage you to try it without sugar for one week. If you remain stoically unaffected then you may return to your faux tea with my faux blessing. There is an exception. If someone has just heard some distressing news (like their aunt has just been severely injured by a swan), then sweet tea is the most appropriate prescription. Also, if you are an OAP, you are allowed to drink tea as sweet as you like with complete impunity. (Thanks Anon_is_a_Meme)

On Biscuits

Digestives or hobnobs. Rich teas are a sick joke and are a trap for those of you who dunk biscuits in your tea. If you must have chocolate coated biscuits then choose a dark chocolate variety, these will leave less chocolate on your fingers.

On Etiquette

•	⁠Tea is a social drink, before you make it enquire as to whether anyone else would like one in the vicinity.

•	⁠Drink at your leisure, coffee is for abusing when deadlines approach

•	⁠Biscuits should be served on a side plate

•	⁠If you make any mess while making tea clear up after yourself

•	⁠It is always best to throw any boiled water and any unused tea away after using the kettle and teapot

It is, when people take ownership over something harvested and processed half a world away.


>""It is unlikely that tea would have the cultural penetration it has in the western world (and the global world) if it were just something relegated the the occasional sipping by people in India.""

As I said, tea production in india was a product of british colonialism. The chinese had been exporting tea before that, and it was already known in the west. Yes, it was made more available to the masses, but let's be honest - even though you can get it in every supermarket, tea is STILL a very niche topic. Most people have no idea what is is, how it is made, where it comes from, and use the term interchangebly with anything brewed from any plant.
Now people have been getting more into chinese tea, there are more specialized shops selling a variety of high quality leaves, sourced directly from farmers instead of wholesalers and all that stuff. Who and what do you think is responsible for that developement? It's globalization, but sure as hell not a result of british colonialism. It's mostly chinese immigrants, or descendants of those, as well as some passionate people who visit or move to china to learn about tea, who're trying to educate people about the culture and intricacies of tea production.",0,Potatow-Edge,191m27z,Brew tea like an Englishman,181,65,,"I have the following Reddit post written by a Jerry Kelly (no idea who this is) saved in my notes. I’ve cherished it all these years, and I share it with yall expecting it will provide equal satisfaction.

Brew tea like an Englishmen

On boiling the water

Cold water. Boil it once. Pour immediately into a teapot (If you are making tea for just yourself a mug is acceptable) Left over water in the kettle from last time? Throw that shit away.

On Teapots

This is never cleaned.

•	⁠Your friend thinks it would be a great idea to make cocktails in it? Throw it away.
•	⁠Sick in it? Throw it away
•	⁠Cleaned with anything other than just hot water? Throw it away. Your teapot should have a tea cosy, it is frowned upon if this is not chequered or floral. Bonus points if it matches your tea towels. Regarding the tea cosy: it is entirely acceptable, if not required, that you put it on your head and refer yourself as the Bishop. (Thanks to iamtheparty) As pointed out 'warming the pot' is a common practice whereby a small amount of boiled water is added to the tea prior to the teabags and swirled around. This is to make sure the tea is piping hot. In my opinion this is not strictly necessary but comes under the banner of 'cocking about'.

On Mugs

Teacups and saucers are only used to impress people that you do not want to come to your house. Use a mug. Mugs should be large, clean and most importantly yours * Not your Dad's * Not one that you found at the back of the cupboard at your office kitchen, even if it is the only one that does not smell like off milk. * It must be your own mug. There are many like it but this one is yours. You do not use it at 3am when you feel the need for bathroom tap water. You do not use it to keep your stationary in. You do not permit anyone else to use it. This mug is for tea and tea alone.

On Brands of Tea

Most people have a preference to which tea brand they like. Personally I'm a big fan of Yorkshire tea. PG tips, in my opinion, are of the devil. If someone were to hand me a cup of it, I would drink it. I'm British anything else would be impolite. We will cover etiquette later. Students Red label tea from Sainsbury's is fantastic for its cost. On Tea Leaves Some people have got the time to make loose leaf tea. Well done you. How was art school? I also like loose leaf tea. I drink it when I have nothing better to do or am at a tea shop and have the leisure time to deal with loose leaf. On the whole though, teabags will suffice. Yes they will. Stop it.

On Brewing

One teabag per person and one for the pot. Do not deviate from this method. You do not know better. Again taste varies for the strength of your tea. It is vital, VITAL that you do not over brew the tea. Some of the naturally stronger teas like Yorkshire should not be brewed for long as they will become bitter.

•	⁠Don't go and have a piss.

•	⁠Don't go and chat up that lovely bird in Finance.

•	⁠Don't play Angry Birds.

•	⁠STAY. THE. FUCK. THERE. If you have used a teapot, after a minute use a spoon to stir a few times. Brewing time should be around 4 minutes. Pour a little out into your mug to check the strength. If it is the colour of a dark ale such as Otter then the tea is at a good strength. If you have used a mug stirring regularly is fine. A good indicator of when your tea has reached a good strength is that you can only see the top 1/2 inch of the teabag due to the darkness of your beverage.

On Milk

People vary in their taste for strong tea. While brewing strength is important milk will also lower the strength of your tea. Add it slowly, preferably from a small jug rather than from an ungainly 6 pint milk bottle. You do not want to make a mess, that would be unseemly. Some people say that you must add milk first before adding tea. Some people also believe that pluto isn't a planet. Fuck those people. I have found that it makes very little difference. Much in the same way that if you were dropped into hot liquid you would scream the same amount as if you had boiling liquid poured onto you.

1921sr7,kh0o7wo,"That sounds amazing! I'm a fan of particularly roast-y yanchas, and I agree, it seems like most people don't roast as deep as they used to.",2,FieryArmadillo,1921sr7,I've Started Custom Ordering Yan Cha (story),11,2,,"This year and last year I have asked my award winning Yan Cha making friend to do a custom   
roast.  


Since first coming to China I have been looking for a high quality fully roasted yan cha. While I have found plenty of high quality teas they tended to be low to medium roast, very few were high roast. Infact in general very few teas were high roast.

I asked many makers why there was so little high roast as time passes Im able to piece to together the more and more of the picture. High roasts use to be the norm but recently they have fallen out of favor, in part becuase new drinkers dont want to wait for the heat to cool off they prefer to enjoy more quickly. The focus now is more on the aroma as well.  Giving a tea a full roast is also a little risky because you risk over roasting it. Once it is over roasted then you cant go back.

That being said I still wanted high quality yan cha at a fully roast. So after countless trips to Wuyi and even living in the area I decided I was going to need to custom order the tea.

I reached out to Mr. Wu. Mr.Wu was my first contact in Wuyi Shan way back in 2017 and competition wise, the most successful. He has won countless awards, mostly for his rou gui, and done quiet well for himself.

[Mr. Wu being regonized. ](https://preview.redd.it/86hibx6udbbc1.jpg?width=1620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c5ccc06404c36540f8a0a22c6fb38d32449aef88)

I reached out to him because three years prior he had produced a Rou Gui that was at the level I wanted and delicous. I asked him to do it again and he agreed.

A month or so later he told me the tea was ready. He sent me a sample and it was an amazing tea. It was complex and full of flavor. Tasting like warm apple pie. There was one problem...it was a medium roast. I almost considered just accepting the tea the way it was. But no....I wanted a full roast. I asked him to roast it again and he agreed and a week or so later sent me a higher roast. Still not satisfied I asked him to roast it again. He agreed but more hesitantly.

""Are you sure?""""Yes""""This is not what people usually want""""I know. But this is what I want""

He roasted it again, sent me the sample.......And it was amazing! The body was full, thick but smooth with light tannins. Even he said it tasted like red wine, which it did.

The cool thing was that since it was fresh off the charcoal the tea still had heat. When yan cha is made it needs a resting time to lose the heat. with such a new tea i got to taste the affect of a tea having too much heat. The flavors were strong and a bit fuzzy, not very clear. As time went on the flavor profile settled, became more complex and clear and a beautiful aroma emerged.

This year I asked for the same roast but with Shui Xian. Because Shui Xian is a larger leaf it will carry the roast differently. This year he knew exactly what I wanted and roasted it to just the right level on the first try. While still having the heat, the aroma was like stepping into a coffee shop full of freshly roasted beans. Im excited to see how the profile will develope as the tea cools.

I applauded him after tasting the tea.

""Few people would dare make such a roast."" He told me ""It takes great skill to do it this well.""

He was being a little boastful, but I didnt mind. He had earned it.

The tea tray was an inexpensive one from Amazon with a plastic bottom, but I like that for easy cleaning, and no risk of it leaking. Plus I like that the design has a bit of personality.

I ordered 25g samples of several different teas from White2tea. I'm trying to figure out what I like. I was pleasantly surprised to find out they included a sample of their 2020 Natural Redhead as well.

I couldn't decide which one to try first, but I wanted something that would be agreeable to my parents. So I tried the 2023 Big O V3.

I brewed about 5g in a pseudo-gongfu style. A quick 5 second rinse, and an initial steep of about 7 seconds. I'm brewing 250 ml of tea so I can serve some to my parents.

First of all, the colour of the tea is beautiful. Orangey red, like a sunset over the ocean. Gorgeously clear. And my goodness the flavour of Big O v3 is just magnificent. Ripe pu'er warmth with just a touch of pleasant funk, but then the citrus notes really liven it up in a way that isn't overpowering, just complementary. Spectacular.

The picture is the process of brewing it just now. You can see the color for yourself. Its taste is different.  When I brewed it for the first time, its color was relatively light (perhaps due to my habit of brewing quickly), so the soup had a light nectar aroma.  After brewing for the second time, the tea soup stayed for 5-10 seconds. This time, the color of the tea soup was more mellow. There was only a faint floral and fruity aroma in the mouth. When it entered the throat, there was a fruity honey aroma returning, which was a light sweetness.  The levels are completely different.

191q8pb,kgxfsct,"TGY can be roasted in different degrees or unroasted, with more or less oxidation. So it is difficult to predict if it will be stronger than Japanese greens. If it is low oxidation and unroasted, the taste is quite delicate. If you open it up, you can probably already tell where your journey is going.

I like the greener ones and drink them either gong fu, starting with 25-30 seconds and adding 5-10 seconds per steep, or ""half western"", with a good amount of leaf and 1.5-2 min steeping time (which is good for 3-4 steeps).",5,just_blue,191q8pb,Tie Guan Yin?,13,18,image,"Can anybody tell me about Tie Guan Yin?

What to expect in terms of flavor, etc., especially for someone who up until now has only drank Japanese green teas. I understand from a cursory Google search that it is an oolong (correct me if I’m wrong). I know it will taste stronger than the senchas I usually drink, are oolongs generally bitter? Brisk? Grassy?

I found it at the bottom of my tea drawer, so I’m not sure how old it is. I believe it must belong to one of my family members who used to be a big oolong drinker.

191x6ja,khaajae,"This probably doesn't help you much if you already have a preferred tea set/gaiwan you want to use, but I just got this lovely ""360 degree swiveling gaiwan"" travel set (which includes a tea tray) and am enjoying it.

Of course, while it arguably has a gaiwan-and-pitcher and is marketed as ""gongfu"", it's not suitable for serving multiple cups at once, gongfu-style. It's fine for serving a single person (which is how I typically use it), but since the ""gaiwan"" actually sits (and swivels) inside of the pitcher, with no barrier between them except a filter, functionally it's much more like a teapot than a traditional gaiwan (if I were serving for two, I would first pour into a second pitcher, and *then* pour into cups, the pitcher in the set certainly isn't for ""fairness""). If you don't normally use ""lazy""/automatic gaiwans, it also pours more slowly (via the pitcher) into a cup than you can pour a traditional gaiwan into a pitcher or cup, so you may have to adjust your steep time by the fact that the water will remain in contact with the leaves a tad longer as you are decanting.

Oh! And, since the water level is shared between the gaiwan and the pitcher it sits inside, I don't think it's useful for infusions of less than \~100mL at a time. I use it when I want larger portions of tea, and either use a non-gongfu teacup, or else I pour two cups and drink them both. :)",1,micahcowan,191x6ja,a travel tea tray?,1,7,,"I've a nice little travel tea set. two cups that nest into a gaiwan that nests into a gong dao bei.

Citrus and malt on the nose.
Nice thick mouthfeel with a little astringency.
Orange on the finish with a touch of bitterness, almost made it like grapefruit.
Palate was more citrus and just a little bitterness to start.

Would be interesting to do head to head with this and Ketlee’s first flush Darjeeling.

Tea rounded out to delicious citrus and malt with almost no bitterness on 11th infusion.
More lemongrass than oranges at 13th infusion.
Finish was quite long lasting and stuck thick to back of tongue.
Not much malt left in the nose on 17th infusion.

Mouthfeel on this tea was definitely very good and enjoyable.

Did 1st to last comparisons. 2nd infusion was like lemon chocolate truffle with briskness, while 2nd to last was more rounded lemongrass. 1st was refreshing lemons at this point, while last was almost pear like in body and sweetness. I would definitely like a cold tea like what that 1st infusion was selling.

Onto the big question in my head throughout this session: why get this instead of the Darjeeling first flush, or vice versa? I have no idea. So get both. You won’t be disappointed, unless citrus and lemongrass aren’t your thing.

I wish all tea shop teas were as consistently good to great as Ketlee’s.

Sorry to disappoint but there is no chance you're getting genuine yixing for a tenner. That doesn't mean it's a bad gaiwan, it's just not yixing clay.

>I brewed some smoked Lapsang Souchong in it a couple of times which is quite a strong flavour. Is that going to impact it?

It'll be absolutely fine. Maybe if you brewed shou pu erh in a clay pot for several years and then brewed a really floral oolong you might get some unexpected results.

191prb5,kgxizva,"Making tea is about brewing a certain amount of leaves with a certain amount of water for a certain amount of time with a certain temperature.  
If you can control all these parameters enough for your needs and the tea has enough space to open up, you won´t have a benefit in taste by changing your brewing vessel.

If you mean a large 1+ liter tea pot with ""regular"", then a smaller vessel will have a benefit if you intend to brew ""really good"" tea. Because ""really good tea"" is often brewed best with relatively high leaf-water ratios, and with many steeps.

If your options are a Kyusu or a cast iron pot, go for the Kyusu. Because that´s meant to (and better in) brewing tea, a cast iron pot is for heating water. Another really simple, but really good option is just a metal basket infuser that you put directly into a cup.

Longer infusions now bringing out a bit of bitter but still no smoke, Sweet is hanging on, though. Six infusions in without much change. Hitting the caffeine wall with my earlier Sencha.

For instance, Kenyan tea production is primarily large factory farming of commodity grade teas, with workers generally underpaid by western standards.

They focus on orthodox tea production with higher wages, plus hiring much of the rest of the town in the area to produce the hand-carved spoons and decorative product wrapping.

1919fbr,kgtxyo1,">yixing teapot

Yixing is an extremely expensive type of clay which's also very porous and will absorbs tea aroma so it should be rsther used for one more specified type of tea.  Eventually you can buy some but it will be expensive and it will be much more specific. Yixing isn't necessarily bigger than gaiwan, it's volume vary alots depending on the particular teapot, so is a gawian also. 

>Or maybe some cast iron teapot

Nah  iron teapots are actually pretty bad for making a tea. They are good as a kettle though.


You may consider kyusu (yokode kyusu) teapot, it's volume vary but typically it's somewhere like 200-400ml. It has built in ceramic strainer to the teapot or eventually it has some metal strainer (typically built in, though I prefer ceramic one).  If you don't want a teapot to affect the tea taste then glazed kyusu could be a good choice. If you want the tea taste to changes it's taste then you can go for clay kyusu, especially if you like japanese greens. Particularly Tokoname clay is known for it's enchancing japanese tea taste, it reduces astrigency  enchances the umami. Though it should be mentioned here that tokoname clay is definitely less porous than say yixing

Kyusu is japanese teapot for typically japanese tea  though it will be very suitable for any kind of tea, it's also very convienient 

From other japanese ceramics there are shiboridashi's and   houhins. Though they will be typically quite small or very small (for example shibos can vary alot, shiboridashi can have like 100ml for example, but also alot less, I one shibo which holds 40ml of water)",9,I__Antares__I,1919fbr,Better way to brew tea for beginners,8,34,,"Hi

You brew grandpa style by putting the tea leaves in a cup or glass, fill it with hot water, and just drink once it has cooled down enough without removing the leaves. Once the cup or glass is half empty, you refill with hot water. Repeat until the flavor is gone or you no longer want to drink.

Long Jing - a green tea with a nutty, sweet, and slightly roasted aroma. 1-2 teaspoons per cup (~300 mL), water around 80°C.

Shou Mei - a white tea with a gentle sweetness reminiscent of very ripe fruit (e.g. apples or peaches). 2-4 teaspoons per cup, water around 80°C.

Lao Cha Tou - a fermented pu‘erh tea yielding a creamy sweetness similar to cocoa or milky coffee. 2 nuggets per cup, boiling water.

1910p9t,kgrzwry,">black, white, green tea etc. that it comes from different parts of the tea plant

No. They are all made of tea leaves. Sometimes stems are included, but with few exceptions this is a sign of lower-quality tea. Different tea types are processed differently. 

>what does it mean when it says English Breakfast is a mix of black teas?

You know how if you buy three different brands of cheddar cheese they all taste slightly different because they come from different farms in different climates and maybe they have different breeds of cows? Tea is like that. English Breakfast, for example, is a mix of teas grown in different parts of Sri Lanka, Kenya, and India.

>with flavored teas, are they simply adding say jasmine leaves in with the tea leaves? And with earl grey they are adding the bergamont to the leaves? t isn’t artificial flavors?

Sometimes it is artificial flavors. With Earl Grey especially it is usually artificial flavor unless it's a higher-end Earl Grey, because bergamot is a little expensive. Low-priced jasmine tea also probably uses artificial flavors rather than real jasmine flowers. But yes, for nicer teas they are adding real bergamot citrus oil or real jasmine flowers during the processing stage. The jasmine flowers are usually removed after that stage because they can add a bitter flavor and all we want is the aroma.",46,YesWeHaveNoTomatoes,1910p9t,Can someone explain the difference between black teas?,12,7,,"Ok I don’t know if I am putting in the wrong  keywords in Google or what, but I’m not getting good answers.

No, the defining differences are in the processing. Oxidation, primarily, but also fermentation and application of heat.

> what does it mean when it says English Breakfast is a mix of black teas?

Here, ""black teas"" refers to fully oxidized teas from different parts of the world. They might combine an assam (from Assam), a ceylon (from Sri Lanka), and a keemun (from Qimen).

You can of course get more specific, eg an assam of cultivar XB2 from the Thanit estate of grade FTGFOP harvested in SP23.

190yzly,kgs9fr6,"Thats a wonderful start! Tea can be as complicated or as simple as you like. There are general temperatures for each tea type, and steep times are another one of those. If you are using a tea ball this is a decent guide (below). 

Where things get more complicated (i feel anyway) is chinese teas. These are much more ""pure"" tea than you will typically find in a bag or at the store. So its much more potent. Chinese teas even in small amounts can make multiple cups of tea if prepared correctly. I have found they are easier to ""burn"" aka steep too hot and get bitter though. Bagged tea can withstand a bit more of a beating temp and time wise as its just more processed. 

There are a ton of ways to brew tea and you will find what you like, expecially if you keep an eye on this sub. There are also good guides linked in the sub discription :) have fun and dont get too overwhelmed. The world of tea is big!

190yzly,kgt4nur,"I find myself disagreeing slightly with the warnings on temperature and Chinese teas. Of course it is good advice to use appropriate temperatures and brewing times, but it’s not so hard that anyone has to steer away from loose leaves. To my taste, an over steeped loose leaf tea will most of the time be better than properly steeped bagged tea.

On Chinese teas, I often see people writing that they are finicky, but I regularly abuse both fresh sheng puer and Chinese whites and the tea is always enjoyable (though I must admit the sheng can get a bit harsh). “Grandpa style” is also a popular way to drink them, where you just put the leaves straight into a big cup, pour hot water on it, and drink when it’s cold enough (never removing the leaves from the cup).",6,laksemerd,190yzly,Recommendations for beginner?,8,34,self,"I've only had tea made by other people or tea from a restaurant.

I drink a lot of Liu Bao and accidentally having one of those leaves in your mouth isn’t a pleasant experience.

For Chinese teas, I find myself not really using it for larger leaf teas that don't tend to have many broken leaf bits that can make their way through the filter. A rinse is normally enough to rid the tea of any bits of dust that may be present.

For smaller leaf teas that may have more broken bits, I find the filter valuable. It especially finds use when I am drinking very broken leaf Japanese greens such as tencha or fukamushicha.

The filter is definitely a more recent addition to the list of gong fu utensils.

I started drinking tea a few years ago, bought a small teapot, a pitcher and tiny cups at a street market and tea leaves at various vendors.  Now, back in ""the States"" I largely, well, only buy tea online, sad to say.  I miss the in the teashop tasting and talking ritual.  

Somewhere along the line i acquired a thing to add to the tea wares on hand.  I had never seen it before and have never seen anyone use it.  It's intended use was immediately apparent, and I now use it almost all the time.  But I sometimes wonder when it burst upon the scene (they certainly didn't have this in old China), and sometimes I even am curious as to why we use it, why I never saw it used when i was learning about this insidious addiction.  Were my tea teachers withholding information, unaware of this implement, or just sloppy (or some other more respectful condition) of habit?

My drinking has evolved over time (I graduated from those thimble-sized clay cups to ones that hold an entire teapot's worth of brew and even have a mug that is working it's way into the mix) and I have incorporated this thingie into my routine.  I am speaking of course, about the tea strainer.  Not the infuser.  This is a small, funnel-shaped piece of stainless steel that has a fine mesh at the smaller opening.  It fits nicely into any of my usual tea pitchers and holds back smaller bits of leaf. Does everyone use this?  It clogs up occasionally and acquires discoloration from the tea it processes (which causes me to wonder whether I ought to have one for each of the large category teas (oolong, puer, green and white) as is recommended for the teapots in which I brew this nasty stuff.  

Any thoughts about this both irrelevant and interesting yet deeply naive and tedious inquiry would be thankfully read (by me, at least).

The flavour is that of a typical Assam, rich and deep, malty and a slight sweetness. There’s no astringency in this at all and it’s a beautiful tea to drink. 

Overall I highly recommend if you love Assam teas, and tea in general. It’s a perfect example of an Assam, and to be quite honest wasn’t expecting it to be that good due to it being organic but I have to say that it’s an impressive organic tea for sure.

Just get a nice shui ping, pick a tea or a complementary group of teas that you will brew in it and become familiar with how it retains heat and affects your brews.

What I would say is that for shou you probably want something that retains as much heat as possible. So if you brew a lot of shou maybe don’t get a really small pot (<100ml) as they lose heat quicker.

1911uwk,kgthum7,"Thanks for your response! To clarify, I'm looking for 2 clay recommendations here. I plan to assign each tea their individual teapot. Sorry for the lack of clarity!

I feel fairly confident in my ability to learn how a clay/teapot functions. My experience is in Chaozhou, Jianshui, and some local clays, just no experience in Yixing specifically. Is there a reason why clay-tea pairings isn't essential for my first yixing teapot? There are just so many types of Yixing: Zini, Zhuni, Hong Ni, Duanni, Lu Ni, etc. I'd like to hear from those who know the nature of some of these clays, so I can make a decently educated decision.

I've heard Zini and Duanni might be good choices for Shou Pu'er, but I'm afraid that these clays might mute the elements of Shou that I really like. I've also heard that Zhuni and Hong Ni a good clay for green oolongs like Dong Ding, but again, I'd like to hear from those who use these clays to see their opinions. 

100ML is honestly my average when it comes to my 1-person sessions. I think I'd just shift my brewing style to match the loss in heat-retention if its a size issue.

I have a tendency to brew my shou pu'er strong, and have a preference towards the darker earthier shous (i.e. Bulang Shou). Perhaps Zini would be the better option, or something less porous like Zhuni?

Is there a specific reason why you recommend Zhuni for Dong Ding? I've heard other people recommend this because it preserves aroma and is less porous. Just curious of your thoughts.

Also, Xiangyu is such an interesting shape! It reminds me of the Hiragata Kyusu shape from Japan.",1,benbojammin,1911uwk,Yixing Zisha Pairing for Shou Pu'er and Dong Ding Oolong?,1,7,,"Hello, All.

TLDR: What are good Yixing Clays for Shou Pu'er and Dong Ding Oolong? Effects?

EDIT: I'm looking for recommendations for 2 teapots. 

In my years of brewing Gongfu Tea, I have painstakingly avoided Yixing at all cost. I've been a daily user of Jianshui Zitao, Chaozhou clay, and Lizella (a clay from Georgia, US).

Which clays would you recommend for these teas? Extra points if you can recommend a specific teapot shape.

1. **Shou Pu'er:** Full bodied, rich, thick, earthy—something that won't mellow out the shou too much. I brew my shou strong.

1911uwk,kgvjl82,">Is there a reason why clay-tea pairings isn't essential for my first yixing teapot?

In my experience clay-tea pairings aren't necessarily objective and easily-replicable truths. There are a number of reasons for this such as differences between different batches of each clay type, different shapes, firing methods, wall thickness, old/modern clay, etc etc. Or you could even just end up with something that isn't yixing at all.

If you've never tried yixing before it's also tempting to take comments about muting or enhancing at face value and worry that you may purchase the 'wrong' teapot. In the words of one experienced collector: ""*The biggest misconception is the expectation that \[yixing\] will fundamentally change the tea drinking experience. It can, but not necessarily so.""* A nice shou will be nice whether it's brewed in (genuine) zhuni or duanni.

When you're buying your first teapot I think it's important to keep in mind that there is a hierarchy of features that can potentially impact flavour and clay type is not necessarily at the top of the list, nor is it easy to make generalisations about it as I alluded to above. So using clay type as the main criteria for your first pot narrows your options and may not give you the results you think it will. Which brings me back to vendor reputation, aesthetics, ergonomics and volume as more important factors. Clearly if your collection expands and you have a wider reference base then buying based on clay type can make more sense.

If you are really intent on exploring clay-tea pairings and you want this to drive your purchase then there are a lot of quite in-depth discussions on TeaChat and TeaForum about all kinds of combinations of teas and pots. If you do a google search for duanni and shou, for example, you already get a few results from both forums.",3,atascon,1911uwk,Yixing Zisha Pairing for Shou Pu'er and Dong Ding Oolong?,1,7,,"Hello, All.

The Rock Tea market in China is quite intricate. Some small tea merchants from the hills tend to inflate prices based on their tea's place of origin. This discourages many Rock Tea enthusiasts, resulting in the absence of a good brand.

and most traditional locals from Wuyi Mountain are unfamiliar with overseas markets and customers, which is why I aim to create an international brand. My concern is that most overseas customers or tea enthusiasts are accustomed to teabag brands like Lipton, which are not suitable for experiencing Rock Tea.

19097rv,kgmpegg,"Brewed Gong Fu style. 5.2 g tea to 50ish ml water at 212 F. Gaiwan, cha hai, cup warmed. Tea steamed. 5 seconds, 10 s, 15 s, 20s, 25 s, 30 s, 35 s, 40 s, 45 s, 1 minute, 1.5 m, 3 m, 5m, 10 m

Nose started out a nice combination of caramel and florality.
Palate was caramel with hints of charcoal and minerality to start.
Mouthfeel was super silky.
Finish was rich caramel sweetness.

Nose evolved to include a little plum by the 10th infusion.

The aromas coming off the liquor were definitely a cut above in terms of enjoyment and complexity throughout the session.

Empty cup had aromas of vanilla and caramel.

Did 1st to last comparisons. 2nd infusion was light, thick, and a little sweet, while 2nd to last was almost apricots on the nose with plum on palate. 1st infusion was very light, while last was like light honey fruit nectar.

This tea definitely lives up to the billing. It provided for a very good session from beginning to end.

Steamed leaves had aromas of fresh baked bread and raisins.

Nose started out with vegetal note, floral hints, and maybe a little malt.
Mouthfeel started out on the thin side.
Cherries and maybe a little plum on the finish.
Palate had light sweetness and a little bit of briskness to it.

Vegetal note took backseat to the malt on 8th infusion.
Soup thickened to very enjoyable mouthfeel on 9th infusion.

Did 1st to last comparisons. 2nd infusion was  like a good black tea with dark chocolate note at this point (where was this tea during the session?!), while 2nd to last was rounded with raisin notes. 1st infusion was light malt, while last was rounded malt with a tiny briskness.

190lu6z,kguhaso,"Da Hong Pao is a variety of Wuyi rock tea. Broadly speaking, there are two types of Da Hong Pao. One is the pure Qi Dan variety, and the other is a blended tea with various varieties such as Narcissus, Cinnamon, and Tie Luo Han. The advantage of the Qi Dan variety lies in its balanced taste and aroma, with a unique fragrance resembling osmanthus flowers. The blending of Da Hong Pao varies among different tea masters, depending on their preferences and blending skills. Each brand generally has its own unique and proprietary techniques.

As for the rock charm (岩韵) of Da Hong Pao, it depends on the raw materials and processing techniques. In general, only authentic rock-grown Da Hong Pao exhibits a distinct rock charm, often described as a mineral or rocky flavor, which is what you understand as mineral or rocky taste. However, this type of Da Hong Pao typically comes at a normal price ranging from 50 to 300 euros per 250 grams. The depth of the tea color is influenced by the degree of oxidation and roasting. The Da Hong Pao you described seems to be a traditional one with deep oxidation and heavy roasting.",1,iteaworld,190lu6z,Chinese shop recommendations for Da Hong Pao clone,2,7,,"Hi all, I am new to the forum and I hope moderators will publish my post.

“Natural flavors” don’t bother me. I can’t be obsessive about food like that. I also find room for high quality and ‘low quality’ tea in my life. I’m always going to love a basic bagged black tea with milk and sugar, just like I love settling in to a gong fu session with a variety of pure teas.

There are different types of green tea, the Japanese variety has more of a fresh vegetal/grassy taste I prefer Chinese green tea which has a different flavor.  You also have to make sure to heat your water to the correct temperature, boiling water can make green tea bitter and unpleasant.  

I drink mostly green tea, but I do really love a good black tea with milk-the English way also some nice Smokey oolong teas.  But again nothing will compare to sugary sweet drinks till you let your tongue to recover.

1908bb0,kgpju1q,"I grew up in Vietnam, and from my own experience, Vietnamese tea culture is not as deep as Chinese or Japanese. In the South where I grew up, we often have iced jasmine/lotus tea as a water substitute. You can find that in many street vendors. In the North, still a lot of jasmine/lotus tea, but hot or cold depends on the time of year. There is a region of tea growing in the rural, mountainous area north west of Hanoi. Maybe try that as they are quite close to Yunnan. Since the French colonial time, coffee has taken over, and within the last 20 years, boba/milk tea as well.

Edit: forgot about Hue. Hue has a unique tea culture since it’s the capital of the last dynasty.

190d4kc,kgnusw8,"A couple PSAs before I proceed! Firstly, no tea will ever be “honey sweet”, so when I say sweet I mean *it tends to have more sweet notes than other types*. I also don’t think there are truly sweet flavored teas, sweeter than the blackcurrant one you’re drinking. Flavoring comes from essential oils, and they don’t tend to be sweet. Feel free to research essential oils that taste sweet and look for teas that contain this flavor. 

Secondly, I’ve never drunk coffee in my life so perhaps you have higher tolerance for caffeine, but FYI black tea also contains caffeine and therefore makes your heart race (mine for sure). 

Now to the point. There are teas that have less caffeine. Oolong is a fantastic option because it’s naturally sweet and less caffeinated. I recommend milky oolong, it’s the most common type and is available in tea bags, too. 

Herbal teas are caffeine free. There are thousands of blends out there, but a lot of them are also naturally sweet. Camomile is probably the most commercially available one, but there are other blends that are worth exploring. 

So, good for you for taking care of your health! Good luck! Report back when you find your tea!!",3,Simiram,190d4kc,Twinings Blackcurrant Breeze,1,8,,"Ok, while not completely new to tea, I’m trying to switch away from coffee. My reasons:

It's been nearly a year since I been drinking teas instead of soda and juice, I sneaked some here and there ofc but I have a jawline again! (Drink a lot of water too!)

If I wanted coffee, I'd make a builder's brew, which is Assam heavy black tea with milk and sugar — I use Typhoo, which is the British equivalent of Folgers Coffee? Two bags, brewed for six mins, one teaspoon of sugar and enough milk to make it light brown

Yorkshire Gold is a nice step up, PG Tips is an acquired taste imo

If I wanted Sprite, I'd go with Earl Grey, it's divine, I can't even think of a less effette word! Twining's is the one I have but I seriously need to buy a decaffeinated version!

If you just want flavor, try out Bigelow, Zen, Tea of life, any big box brand that sells tea for obscenely cheap prices will have flavored (very cheaply made though) tea's and roiboos any herbal tea is good too

18zvivl,kglyhea,"Hey there, I went with a small group of coworkers and had a wonderful time. I believe you'll be able to accomplish all of your goals there. There was a wealth of knowledge and experience in both the vendors and the attendees, and everyone I met was extremely friendly and eager to discuss. There was also a lot of beautiful tea ware, not sure about custom but I think it's a great place to look.

I attended three panels. My memory is a bit hazy, but one was about different herbal blends and gave us a lot of great ideas. Other panel topics ranged from tea in parts of history or the future, blending, personal stories of tea makers, and how to market your tea company. Not all of them landed for me but i still gained a lot of valuable information. All of the presenters stayed after the panels and were happy to discuss any questions or ideas. 

We got to try a lot of unique and special teas and overall, it was a transformative experience for most of us. I think if you have an open mind and are willing to speak with everyone around you, you'll make a lot of useful contacts and get inspiration for your business. Their app makes it easier to keep track of who you network with as well.

The downside of last year was its conjunction with the bar and restaurant expo, so there was a mix of crowds and the tea expo side seemed tiny in comparison. There were food stands there and the aromas would travel, so there were times it interfered with my senses when trying a new tea. I don't believe that will be the case this year and it will only be WTE, so honestly you'll likely have an easier time networking with only tea folks around. 

As for attire, it was a mix of casual and business casual. I wore a casual dress and zipup hoodie. My coworkers wore shorts+sweater, khakis+blouse, etc There was every kind of attire there other than pajamas so I say don't overthink it and wear whatever is comfortable and makes you feel confident in yourself and your business.

I'm not going this year, but I wish you the best of luck with both your business and at world tea expo! Like a lot of things, the experience is what you make it and if you're bold enough to look for what you want you will find it.

A gooseneck is nice for doing pour over coffee, but also for gongfu cha for precisely pouring into a tiny teapot or gaiwan without spilling. For certain types of teas like green tea (especially Japanese greens) that are high in catechins it is sometimes recommended to agitate the leaves as little as possible during steeping to prevent over extraction of tannins, so a gooseneck helps with this although the difference is probably subtle.

18zs9s2,kgjojnd,"Brewed Gong Fu style. 5 g tea to 50ish ml water at 212 F. Gaiwan, cha hai, cup warmed. Tea steamed. 2 x flash steeps. 5 seconds, 10 s, 15 s, 20s, 20 s, 20 s, 20 s, 25 s, 30 s, 35 s, 40 s, 1 minute, 2 m, 4 m, 8 m

Steamed leaves smell quite delicious with a mix of fruit and a little camphor.
Nose was camphor and note of humidity.
Silky mouthfeel to start, but unexceptional. Hope it thickens during the session.
Finish was thick citrus.
Palate was brisk and bold. Very enjoyable.

Mouthfeel did start thickening on the 5th infusion.
Cream note finally deciphered on nose and palate after liquor calmed down on the 10th infusion.
Finish was long lasting.

The leaves had good endurance, but I definitely pushed too hard with all those 20 second steeps. One less would have been good.

This is another tea that mostly is what it is. Not a lot of evolution during the session. It’s still a step up from last night’s W2T cake in terms of overall package.

Did 1st to last comparisons. 2nd infusion was heavy on the camphor note with bakers chocolate palate, while 2nd to last was cream and citrus nose, smooth palate, thick mouthfeel and that tasty finish. 1st infusion was delicious camphor with nice brisk quality, while last was rounded and also a little brisk, which suggests the leaves had maybe a little more left to give if one wanted to try a 16 or 20 minute steep to finish it out.

This cake is fairly expensive at $148, so whether or not it’s worth it really depends on your preference for the profile. It is a good quality tea that has been stored with care and is very enjoyable for what it is.

First off, a tetsubin is a cast iron kettle. In Japan it is kettles that are typically made of iron, not teapots. A cast iron teapot is not authentic to Japanese tea culture. 

Second, and my biggest issue, is functionality. Cast iron holds heat very well, but it has to suck up a bunch of heat to do so. If you pour boiling water into a cast iron teapot, the iron absorbs a lot of heat and your tea won't be brewed at a high temperature. You can work around this by preheating the cast iron pot. but then you have a very hot pot that can burn/leave marks on your table if you don't place it on a trivet. And theres rusting and other issues. Cast iron is just not an ideal material for a teapot compared to ceramic.",69,redpandaflying93,18z6odi,Why the hate towards Tetsubins?

If this is in-person, you could also hold up different types of teas or place them on the tablet, and they can point to what they want. Or just give them a box with an assortment of choices.

If you are still looking to reduce your overall sugar consumption, I would suggest you shift your attention to any hidden/added sugar lurking in other areas of your diet.  Most of us are consuming more sugar (and salt) than we think via the foods we buy.  It was eye opening and shocking when I started carefully reading the nutritional labels on some of our kitchen staples. We know soda, pastry,  and ice cream should be limited but, you find high amounts of added sugar in many brands of bread, bottled salad dressings/sauces,  frozen foods and more.  It was a bit of a learning curve when we first started to attack that area in our diet, but now we have new staples and we know how to translate ingredient labels and nutrition info quickly so we can make better choices.

This tea offers a captivating experience from start to finish, and the end only arrives when you decide to tap out, as the tea continues to deliver.

The journey begins when you open the container, and you're immediately hit with a scent reminiscent of a recent fire in a pine forest. Breaking it apart leaves your hands, pick, and tray with a lingering aroma, much like the scent that clings to a jacket worn around a campfire the next day.

The initial steep is dominated by a bold smokiness, and the fragrance left in the beaker after pouring transports me back to memories of small Texas BBQ shacks. As you continue to steep, the tea gradually unveils a slightly sweet and juicy young raw familiarity that lurks behind the powerful smokiness. This tea generously offers around 15 full force pots before it begins to lose its intensity, but even then, there's a lingering essence up to the 20th steeping.

In more recent history, instant ramen. The preservation techniques used to make it have done wonders for world hunger, and iirc it's been voted the most influential invention of the 20th century

What about cheap non meat proteins, such as cheese, beans, and tofu? For many people in the past and present, this is their only form of protein intake as meat is often too expensive for them.

Here are three little points that illustrate why the introduction of tea changed history for the better:

* The  Sung dynasty in China saw huge population growth and density as well as  a leap forward in society and culture. Historians are not in agreement  as to what caused this. Tea had just become a common drink after being  domesticated in southern China.
* Starting in the 1300s, Japan  grew economically, politically, and in population. It expanded to take  over neighboring regions and grew more rice than ever due to innovations  in technology. By 1720 it had the largest and densest cities in the  world. Tea had been introduced in monasteries a millennium earlier but  it only became a secular, widespread drink in the 1200s.
* England  started the industrial revolution in the late 1700s. Earlier that  century, gin and beer were the most popular drink and dysentery was a  leading cause of death in London. By 1800, these deaths were basically  gone. Workers needed to pay close attention working machines for hours  and days on end -- gin and beer were no good -- much better to be  drinking tea, which became widespread in the mid-1700s. The coffee/tea  break isn't a generosity for workers, it is to give them a chance to get  hopped up on caffeine and sugar before going back to work.  


Why  is tea so special? The first step to brewing tea is to boil water, for  one, which kills pathogens in otherwise undrinkable water -- this is  vitally important in early cities. Plus it is cheap, shelf-stable,  enjoyable, makes one more alert and less fatigued, and is only mildly  addictive.  
I know you like to look at the gory bits, too, so here are some episodes:

* Opium War: when England got China addicted to opium to trade for tea instead of paying for it.
* Colonization  of Assam: wild tea was found in this English territory, where thousands  died as de facto slaves establishing and working the tea ""gardens.""

>After a hard night’s toil, poling and walking in a nipping frost, I wished to see the breakfast by which they laid the physical basis for another day’s work. At the stern of the boat, resting on a little furnace, was the universal rice-pot, and beside it a small covered wooden tub, full of rice. Some pickled or boiled slices of the huge radish called dai-kon lay in another receptacle. The drink was the cheapest tea ... The first course was a bowlful of rice and a pair of chop sticks. In the second course, history repeated itself. The third course was a dipperful of tea... The fourth course was a bowl of rice and two slices of radish; the fifth was the same. A dipperful of tea-liquor finished the meal, and the pole was resumed. (Griffis, Mikado’s Empire, II, 409–10)

>An added reason \[for lack of disease in Japanese cities\] may well have been the ubiquitous drinking of tea. However careful people in a city of half a million or more are, they are dependent on wells and sluices, and water is bound to become polluted. Yet in Japan, adults and children did not drink cold, unboiled, water. The infants drank their mother’s milk, which would have contained high levels of bacteria-destroying phenolics from their mother’s tea drinking. Adults and children once weaned just drank tea, which was made with boiled water. (Macfarlane and Macfarlane 2004: 79)

Here are three little points that illustrate why the introduction of tea changed history for the better:

* The  Sung dynasty in China saw huge population growth and density as well as  a leap forward in society and culture. Historians are not in agreement  as to what caused this. Tea had just become a common drink after being  domesticated in southern China.
* Starting in the 1300s, Japan  grew economically, politically, and in population. It expanded to take  over neighboring regions and grew more rice than ever due to innovations  in technology. By 1720 it had the largest and densest cities in the  world. Tea had been introduced in monasteries a millennium earlier but  it only became a secular, widespread drink in the 1200s.
* England  started the industrial revolution in the late 1700s. Earlier that  century, gin and beer were the most popular drink and dysentery was a  leading cause of death in London. By 1800, these deaths were basically  gone. Workers needed to pay close attention working machines for hours  and days on end -- gin and beer were no good -- much better to be  drinking tea, which became widespread in the mid-1700s. The coffee/tea  break isn't a generosity for workers, it is to give them a chance to get  hopped up on caffeine and sugar before going back to work.  


Why  is tea so special? The first step to brewing tea is to boil water, for  one, which kills pathogens in otherwise undrinkable water -- this is  vitally important in early cities. Plus it is cheap, shelf-stable,  enjoyable, makes one more alert and less fatigued, and is only mildly  addictive.  
I know you like to look at the gory bits, too, so here are some episodes:

* Opium War: when England got China addicted to opium to trade for tea instead of paying for it.
* Colonization  of Assam: wild tea was found in this English territory, where thousands  died as de facto slaves establishing and working the tea ""gardens.""

You could get more than enough from *The Empire of Tea: The Remarkable History of the Plant that Took Over the World*, by Macfarlane & Macfarlane. If you would like more reading suggestions, I'm glad to put together a list.

I've also brewed a good pot of dan cong oolong using a similar setup to yours, but I reduced the tea to water ratio because I was leaving the infuser and tea in the water (6g tea to 3 cups water). If you follow the guidelines of 1g of tea for every 15ml-20ml water then gongfu is the better way to go because with a large pot like you have the tea becomes bitter and astringent, masking the tea flavor.

18zf709,kgi12n7,"Yorkshire used to be my “house” bagged tea. It’s very good - but now my favorite bagged black tea is Thompson’s Teas Irish Breakfast. 

I use Harney & Sons for flavored black loose leaf teas because they’re well-priced, but I’m started to branch out into other companies for specific teas. My Harney & Sons go-to flavors are Paris, Earl Grey, and Indian Nimbu. I have their French Super Blue lavender to add to other flavors as I see fit. 

I’m looking forward to a shipment of Lilac black tea from Simpson & Vail, my January Sips By subscription box (not too impressed so far, glad I only did three months to start), and a new to me brand Brook37 that had some tins on deep discount.",2,Lower_Stick5426,18zf709,Milk Tea Question,1,7,,"Let me start off by saying that I am not new per-se to tea. I used to be an avid tea drinker, but when I moved out I got preoccupied so I lapsed for a while. I should also mention that I like tea, but usually avoid caffeine unless absolutely necessary, and compared to decaf 'anything' I would go with caffeinated any day.

Anyway... I was looking around for good brands and found either Yorkshire or PG Tips for bagged tea, but an interesting few are Fortnum and Mason and Harney & Sons which do either loose or bagged.

Smoke on the nose to start.
Silky mouthfeel.
Palate had tartness to it along with muscat grapes and a little minerality.
Tartness lingered in the finish at first.

Good beginning.

Smoke on nose dissipated a bit after 6 infusions which allowed muscat grapes to come in along with a floral note.
Tea settled down nicely after 8th infusion.
Finish bloomed to thick coating of back of tongue and nice sweetness.

Did 1st vs last comparisons. 2nd infusion was nice tartness with hints of dark chocolate. 2nd to last was rounded muscat grapes and not much else. 1st infusion was brisk grapes at this point. Last infusion definitely showed the leaves were finally spent.

Not a bad session, but the tea didn’t really evolve after the start much. It did have excellent longevity though and a nice finish. I was expecting more from this tea and it didn’t quite get there. Wouldn’t buy more and I cancelled my club subscription.

18yhvvm,kgax4h6,"Sure, a cursory visual inspection upon brewing will give you some clue as to the quality (hair, odd bits in the soup, etc), but that’s really stuff at the bottom of the barrel. Smell would be another obvious hint, tea (esp. Oolong), would smell sour when it goes off. Knowing the key characteristics of the different types of tea is also a paramount factor. 

As such, in the end, the only real way to learn how to differentiate a good tea from a bad tea, is to drink lots of different teas. I’ve drunk plenty of tea that is “not my cuppa tea” while I recognise to still be of good quality.

Personally, I don't think anyone brews tea the way I like it. So I never expect to have ""the best cup"" outside my house. I'm just grateful to be invited. So don't worry, just enjoy the visit.

My biggest pet peeve with tea in the US is when people throw an old tea bag (that was infused with the aroma of their cupboard) into tap water in a mug and then microwave it. It happens 90% of the time. I'm also frustrated when the cup isn't very clean, which happens more in the UK because more people handwash dishes. I can smell the sponge in the mug. Clean the mugs thoroughly.

It's probably more useful for you to watch some YouTube videos on tea brewing. No need to be fancy. Twinings channel is good enough.

A black tea: tastes like it has a flowery complex-ness (its not just black tea taste). Its smooth and not very bitter. Easy to drink.

Raw sheng: like green tea-ish. But it burns like battery acid a little.

I'm new to tea. I just bought some tea from Beautiful Taiwan Tea, in indiana. I'm enjoying it so far, clumsily brewing it. I want to be able.to drink it at work.

I work in a place where I can't bring in anything but plastic, possibly a metal thermos, under 24 oz. I may be able to get away with a wire strainer, maybe not. I also can't bring in tea, or any liquid that isn't in a sealed container from a store. So no brewing tea and bringing it along. 


I also won't have access to any way to make hot water other than a microwave.

I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas for how I could brew tea and drink it without tea leaves in my mouth.

My only idea so far is to put my tea in bags and brew that way. But for teas that need to be rinsed, it would be tedious to microwave water, rinse, tools, and microwave more water. I'd probably need a large cup of hot water, and a second smaller cup.

If anyone has any ideas or if they know of any like nested plastic cups or anything I could use to brew without it being a pain in the but, I'd he grateful for you sharing.

I'm not duplicating /u/Microshrimp reply, just want to add that Lapsong Soughing really smells like smoke. Its taste is extremely powerfully smoky, like you dripped some liquid smoke in your tea cup. The smell is smoky, the taste is smoke, the body is smoke and only the aftertaste is smoky black tea. (edit: ok maybe not the modern high end one that have the smoke a bit more in control)

If the leaves looked really brown, almost black, and it had a burnt flavor then you almost certainly had one that was roasted and on the higher end of oxidation.  The roasting process doesn't necessarily add actual smoke, but it can.  The greener version of TGY will be more floral tasting.  Higher oxidized TGY will have more stone-fruit flavors.

Then I discovered another way, it might seem odd, but it’s delivered the best tea I’ve ever had and made me abandon coffee. The recipe is as follows:

18xxw0c,kg8caim,"For celestial seasonings teas I use about 10oz of water per bag. I don't really notice any difference if it's a couple ounces more or less, I feel like either way it eventually reaches a peak amount of diffusion that's nearly the same on average and won't really become more concentrated. 

Generally it's best to follow the box directions. If the boxes suggest an amount of water, it tends to be 8oz, but you really don't need to be exact about it. Same for brewing times; unless you're handling something delicate like green tea you can for the most part do 4-5 minutes and you're good. Some boxes of herbal tea, especially the ones that use spices like ginger or cloves, will say 6 or more minutes.

18x2eop,kg1xhg2,"Like someone else said, the US doesn't have much of a tea culture. It has a strong drinking culture (as in alcohol), a strong culture of sodas and smoothies and flavored coffees. So for a population that's very used to incredibly sweet drinks, it makes sense that a tea shop in the US wouldn't survive with just pure teas alone the way it might in other countries. 

I'm originally from Brazil. Practically no tea shops there too, because nobody wants a large hot drink in a super tropical climate where snow and freezing temperatures are a thing from movies. Even with our coffee that we're so famous for, many people drink it in very small and concentrated amounts to get the caffeine hit after lunch (cafezinho). My hometown is also very far from beaches, so seafood isn't a very popular thing because it's so expensive to import. It makes sense that tea in general, and especially pure teas, is much more popular in areas where it grows and has been harvested for centuries. 

I am grateful that there are a lot of options online though!

18xjvpb,kg57dym,"3-4 infusions is pretty standard for most Japanese greens.

120mL is a perfect size for solo sessions with high quality Japanese teas like gyokuro and tencha. No need to get a smaller shiboridashi unless you want to. And why wouldn't you want to? Teaware is awesome! But I wouldn't worry about the loss of space in your pot, that's normal. You're using the right amount of leaf for a kyusu that size.

You are definitely brewing hot for gyokuro, and if it isn't coming out overwhelmingly strong/bitter, then you're probably using a shorter steep time.

In general, Japanese greens are brewed differently than Chinese 'gong fu' teas. Less leaf to water, fewer infusions, and longer steeping times.

However, there is a LOT of variation in how people brew gyokuro. For example, some people will brew it more like sencha, with less leaf and a longer first infusion, and others will use a whole lot of leaf (like 1:1) and do very short infusions. So as long as you are enjoying the final product, that is really all that matters.

If you are looking to start with a good baseline, try this. 4-5g for your 120mL pot. 1st infusion, 60C for 1.5min. 2nd infusion, 60C for 20sec. 3rd infusion, 65C for 40sec. 4th infusion, 70C for 1.5min.

As for gyokuro recommendations, I really like anything from Hibiki-An, and also like trying different teas from Sazen. They both ship from Japan, so I tend to wait till it's time to get a bunch of tea before ordering. Japanese greens do not last a long time like so many other teas, so I only open and drink 1-2 teas at a time. And the rest of the sealed bags go into the fridge for storage.

18wt484,kg06vft,"Ah okay.  So here is what I do, maybe this will help.

First, try to sift your tea using a tea sift.  This helps it infuse with the water better.

Put the tea in the bowl, add a small amount of water first.  When mixed with the tea, it should create a deep green color and more of a paste.  Please note when mixing this paste, use the whisk to also whisk or softly scrape the bottom of the bowl.

Make sure all paste is combined with the water well.  Then slowly add the water amount you would like.  (I, personally add maybe 100 -150ml more.  Not very much, but enough)

Last step, use the whisk again to whisk and aerate the tea.  The W motion is exactly right, but try not to scrape the bottom.  We are just whisking the tea now.  Whisk back and forth in a vigorous motion for about 20-30 seconds.  Carefully remove the whisk and you should have matcha with a nice foam.",16,MaShinKotoKai,18wt484,My matcha making attempt after comments from this sub,90,29,image,Was told I wasn’t making enough foam - this is my attempt after the comments on my post.

18x91we,kg2rxqd,"Brewed Gong Fu style. 4 g tea to 45ish ml water at 212 F. Gaiwan, cha hai, cup warmed. Tea steamed. 5 seconds, 10 s, 15 s, 20 s, 25 s, 30 s, 35 s, 45 s, 1 minute, 1.5 m, 2 m, 3 m, 5 m, 8 m

Steamed leaves smelled like some sort of fruit chocolate truffle. Promising start to the session.

Raspberries on the nose with notes of dark chocolate.
Palate had that nice fruit and maybe a hint of bakers chocolate.
Mouthfeel started out somewhat silky.
Finish had an enjoyable sweetness to it that lingered, particularly around the lips.

Nose and palate fruit gained intensity on 8th infusion and chocolate faded away. Sweetness also increased.
There was also a floral note present throughout the session that I couldn’t quite decode.
Mouthfeel thickened pleasantly as session went on.

This tea just kept getting better as the session wore on. Definitely showed good complexity and longevity.

Fruit evolved to cherries near end of the session. Excellent!

Did first to last comparisons. 2nd infusion was very much that raspberry chocolate mix. 2nd to last was very rounded full of cherries. 1st infusion had aromas similar to Scotch or maybe brandy while palate was dominated by the dark chocolate. Last infusion was like some sort of cherry liqueur in a good way. The evolution of this tea during the session was really good.

I missed going to teahouses, his channel gave me the vibe I missed, and I got the goods I was looking for during a shitty two years. I’ve never met him or interacted outside of TikTok comments and customer service emails. 

It’s almost like I show up in these threads because *I subscribe to the same tea subreddits you do and disagree with you*. I’ve said a thousand times that I don’t like most online store navigation and that I like buying in person and that a human connection is important to me, and that that was what I missed and got from JT. I’d rather buy shittier tea and get the illusion of a human connection than get great tea from YS, because I’m a different person than you who got into tea for different reasons. When I purchase a tea, I don’t really remember all the details of what it was or what year it was harvested, I remember the person I bought it from and what it was like to drink tea with them. 

Every fucking time I show up in one of these threads to defend my experience of a seller who I had good interactions with and to defend the specific service he provides to entry-level tea people, one of you comes in to make shill accusations and insult me. I can’t imagine why someone like me would now view people like you negatively, or with hostility. We both agree that he does large markups and isn’t selling the most amazing stuff out there, and I say so openly…and then I say that *to a certain type of customer, that’s fine* because you and I are different people.

Frankly I find people like you insufferable. Which is why I make these responses. The whole reason I got into tea was because of the feeling and vibe I got from going to tea shops and talking to people in them. Jesse gave me that experience. Taobao and YS and those other joints didn’t. I pay for the experience I want, because I’m a different fucking person than you are.

18wv5a1,kg2rtgg,"I used to believe 80% of the caffeine would be released in the first steep. Turns out this was a myth.  Someone posted an actual scientific paper and they actually had measured caffeine and it is pretty consistent each steeping. It's just the water temp over time.

These webpages also link to the respective studies, TL;DR for those curious.



The results that emerged from the study were as follows.

Time	|Caffeine Removed	|Avg percent per minute	
30 seconds	|9%	|18% / min	
1 minute	|18%	|18% / min	
2 minutes	|34%	|16% / min	
3 minutes	|48%	|16% / min	
4 minutes	|60%	|15% / min	
5 minutes	|69%	|14% / min	
10 minutes	|92%	|9% / min	
15 minutes	|100%	|6% / min	

According to a study by Dr. Bruce Branan, Professor of Chemistry at Asbury College (Wilmore, KY), it takes a three-minute infusion just to remove 46-70% of the caffeine from a cup of tea.

In the end, no, I think 1-2 rinses would remove much caffeine.


Edit: I went through the other article linked in another comment, very good article.



It discussed something like 20% caffeine removal at 30sec and 33% at 1min, and they noted that that was for crushed up tea, stirred vigorously, ""rather than the 9% yielded with traditional steeping""

I thought this was a good point: While Caffeine can vary by tea type, it is really about the bush and season and not the fact that it is black or green.

How much effect does this really have? It probably affects delicate teas a lot. If you have strong flavored/smelling stuff like chenpi or super smokey teas in there, I bet they might leach into the delicate stuff over time.

Grabbed a bunch of tea from hometown market

I know supermarket quality can be hit or miss for puerh in particular. Smelling through the papers, all but one cake smell great, and even that one smells decent. The jars are more mixed quality (detailed reviews below), generally far better than I expected for the price, but a couple total duds.

I’d love to buy nicer cakes for sure, but I could get these with EBT/SNAP, and as a grad student, I’ll take adequate over nothing. 

**Does anybody know if anything I have here in the cakes punches above the “$8-12 grocery store find” weight class? Or have any info on these teas at all?**

Some of the loose teas, I’ve sampled (or tossed) prior to posting, the rest I drank yesterday and today, so here are some thoughts on the haul. Cake details TBD, I suppose! Excited to crack into those because previously, I’ve just ordered samples on and off, mostly from Yunnan Sourcing, or I’d get decent shou when visiting my local tea and coffee spot. So, this is a turning point for my puerh enthusiasm, and I know there are a couple gems like the Menghai or the CNNP, but I don’t know if anything else is really worthwhile. 


Moving from left to right, top to bottom:

- The red tin is labeled Tie Guan Yin. I wasn’t familiar with Tieguanyin, so I didn’t know what it was when I picked it up, I just liked the packaging and price point. **It’s a really nice oolong!** The only description beyond Tie Guan Yin is the text “high quality selection, tasteful gift.” There’s not even importer or origin information on here. The sticker MAYBE says Blooming Greens Inc, but the font is too small and the sticker is reflective, so it’s hard to tell. If you see it, it’s worth the $12ish gamble.

- The next two jars are glass jars with well-sealing lids. These were $10 or slightly more than that. Both are good for the price. Easy daily drinkers. One is oolong and the other is puer. Both are DMD Bridge Brand. Neither gives much information about the tea itself other than the generic name. Import/production information is given as: A product of Hong Kong Jiaxing Trading Co Ltd. 
  - Oolong: my wife has a great palate and is the cheapest woman I know; she said this was a solid purchase. Google machine translate tells me that it says Taiwan Oolong somewhere on the back label, while in English it just says Oolong Tea, as well as giving import and nutrition info.
  - Pu Er: it’s labeled aged puerh; I think that means it’s an aged sheng, but one of you should correct me on that if I’m wrong to assume so. No other information is given beyond the back listing it, per Google machine translation, as “special grade puer tea.” Not a wild tea by any means. Black tea aroma, some woodland musk. Brews the same way. Three decent steeps (30-60 seconds each) and then a couple less characterful ones. I’ll try flash steeping next time to see if that gets me more mileage. 

- I mentioned in the OP that the one container was a total waste. It was also “DMD Bridge brand Aged Pu Er Tea.” But in a lower quality plastic container with shrink wrap around the plastic screwtop lid. It just smelled like mildew and dirty laundry. No discernible scent of tea. No good aromas, no good funk. I like rich puerhs and I also enjoy drinking beers like true lambic or geueze, so I don’t shy from funky, earthy, “unconventional” flavors; this wasn’t that. Didn’t even brew it. Just dumped the contents and recycled the jar (which smells strongly like the tea even after bleaching; I considered using it for tea storage until the aroma wouldn’t dissipate). 

- paperboard canister labeled Yunnan Pu Er Tea. Golden Bridge Brand. Distributed by JNL(USA) Int’l Inc of Diamond Bar, California. Ten dollars well spent. Black tea, mushroom-like (almost like opening a package of dried shiitake), woody, almost a hint of black pepper. Flavor dissipates after just 2-4 brews, but oh well. Since I’m new to brewing puer at home, I don’t know nearly enough to tell if this is shou or sheng. 

- cardboard canister of “High Mountain Oolong Tea” distributed by Wei-Chuan USA. This was another great $10 spent. My wife enjoyed it and will make this one her daily drinker. My kids also liked it! I liked it but didn’t drink enough to give thoughtful feedback beyond very floral and a tiny bit grassy. The label advertises 8-10 steeps, and that’s about what I got out of it. No real information on source. The canister says, quite nicely (per Google machine translation): 
> The spirit of tea that has lasted for hundreds of years is still repeating the voice of praise. For thousands of years, the tea garden of the shop is unfolding a transparent and flexible artistic picture. Clear water, clear waves, leaping fish, fishermen, shadows of willows on the dike.

- the brown tin (top right), Ronshing puerh, is another total waste. Also smells only like mildew and rot. No tea aroma, no redeemable character. Brewed with the same aroma. Didn’t end up drinking it. My wife hated the smell. My kids hated the smell. My cats probably even hated the smell. 

- Dragon Balls. Pu’er Tea. Might **also** be Blooming Greens Inc. (brand possibly indicated on aforementioned red tin), but logo font is too small to tell here too. Each ball is 7.7 g, based on weighing a sample of 5. 27 balls in a $5ish plastic container. Smelled like generic puer when brewed. Nothing too funky. Nothing too notable. Dull flavor after the first steep. Probably wouldn’t buy again but glad to have tried. Back label says the following (in Roman/English letters) under nutrition information:
> Wellworth inc
> xiang gang zhan jun huan qiu you xian gong si

- Hazo Pu Er Tea. Horng Yih Tea Factory Co., Taiwan. A perfectly adequate, inoffensive puer in a nice tin. Only get a couple good brews out of it. Earthy, a little woody spice.

18wwcsl,kg0w9g6,"No specific brand recommendations since I bought mine years ago, but what I would look for.

Gooseneck: I will never go back to non-gooseneck after having these (Had one at work too when I used to have to go in to the office). Pouring is so easy to control both flowrate and exactly where you're pouring with absolutely no splash. 

Temperature hold: If you're like me and wander off, this is pretty huge. 

Heating element under the base. I think this is standard now, but old ones used to have a heating element in the water that would become corroded really fast.

No plastic touching the water. This isn't huge, but hot plastic isn't great for you, and so many options out there don't have plastic touching the water, so why bother?

I would prefer to have either a dial or touch buttons to set temperature. My current one you have to cycle through the temps and it's annoying especially since my wife tends to use the temp one up from the one I like (so she hits it once to get to hers, I then hit it 5 times to cycle back to mine) - but if budget was a huge factor I'd overlook this.

Last thing would be going over reviews: Is rust an issue? Do they last? I always go to 3 star reviews on amazon for the most useful information. Then 1 and 2 stars, but they tend to be dramatic. 5 star reviews I usually just glance at.

This year, we were unable to go out to a teahouse due to our new 3-month old daughter, so I decided to put together afternoon tea at home for us. Husband had gifted me a tea set from Wedgwood as I told him I daydreamed of having tea parties with our daughter someday. The dream is coming true. I am so excited to include our daughter in this annual tradition. 

Do you have any tea traditions?",22,pfenefer,18wcqhy,What are your tea traditions?,88,7,,Tea: Harney & Sons - Golden Monkey (taken with  a lump of sugar and splash of cream),pfenefer,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18wcqhy,1,1
18wcqhy,kfy8frn,"The tea traditions in my heritage (Malaysian Chinese) is the Chinese tea ceremony during weddings.

The Malaysians word of tea is ‘teh’ which is taken from Hokkien dialect spoken in province of Fujian, China. However, Cantonese happens to be spoken widely in Kuala Lumpur. Cantonese is also a Chinese dialect and here tea is known as ‘cha’.

There are a couple of tea’s which the Malaysians love to drink and among them are the ‘the tarik’ which translates to ‘pulled tea’ and ‘teh o ais’ which means sweet black iced tea.

‘Tehtarik’ this is the most famous variation of tea which is available across Malaysia. The Malaysian street has many kopitiam’s or coffee shops. People come here to enjoy ‘tehtarik’ with snacks or meals. Besides the kopitiam there are ‘mamaks’ which are local tea shops and offer twenty four hour service. ‘Mamaks’ are famous for local gatherings.

Malaysia has a blend of Western and Chinese tea drinking cultures which have delve deep in their culture. It reflects Malaysia as a multi-cultural society.

The most important beverage which is enjoyed by all the Malaysians is the ‘tehtarik’.

The ‘tehtarik’ is prepared by adding condensed milk to a brew of strong black tea. The condensed milk is sometimes mixed with hot milk also. This mixture is poured from a height back and forth which creates sweet froth on top of the tea. Besides helping to mix the tea and condensed milk the tea also cools down and is brought down to a temperature which is just right for drinking.
There are many competitions held in Malaysia where experts come and display their techniques of pouring ‘tehtarik’. They whip milk through the air and go as high as possible displaying various techniques of pouring it.

The ‘tehtarik’ originated from the Indian Muslim immigrants who were staying in the Malay Peninsula. They set up stalls in front of the rubber plantations after the World War II. The workers drank this tea as refreshment. Serving ‘tehtarik’ with ‘roti canai’ is very famous in Malaysia. It is a sort of breakfast which is quite popular.

Besides the ‘tehtarik’ which is prepared by adding milk to it the other version which is quite popular is the ‘teh o ais’. There is no tea added in this type of tea and is had cold.

The ‘teh o ais’ prepared by steeping a tea bag or some tea leaves in hot water for about 30 seconds. To this liquid sugar syrup and some lime juice is added and finally it is topped with some ice. This is a refreshing drink and is loved by the Malaysians. They usually have it in the late afternoons.",4,Curious_Koala_312,18wcqhy,What are your tea traditions?,88,7,,Tea: Harney & Sons - Golden Monkey (taken with  a lump of sugar and splash of cream),pfenefer,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18wcqhy,1,1

18wtnus,kfzypx0,"I could be wording this way wrong, but from what I can tell, you'd be looking for English Breakfast tea (which might be the more popular term if you're looking for it on sale, at least in the US). While you can use both terms for the same tea that is typically used in boba stores, orange peoke seems to be a grading system more than the actual type of tea. It's definitely become one of my favorites with milk and sugar precisely because it reminds me of boba!

Generally speaking, loose leaf teas will give you better quality. The tea leaves aren't grinded down in a way that reduces taste, and a huge part of extracting flavor in the brewing process is allowing for tea leaves to expand. Typically, tea in tea bags (at least your usual grocery store kind, like Lipton) is grinded/cut (?) down to a strange dust where there isn't as much of the flavor left. It might also have other dirt particles since it's harder to separate when the leaf isn't intact.

You don't have to get a bag this big like I do, but I get bags like this. If you grab the loose leaf version and some kind of tea infuser (could be something like this, or this, I'm certain you'll find many more designs for it), I think you'll find a much higher quality of tea! You could also make it in a teapot or a larger container like this, but I find the smaller metal infusers are the simplest (in terms of cleaning) and most beginner friendly. :)

If you're ever curious about how different the loose leaf tea is from the bagged one, you can take a tea bag, cut it open, and take a look inside and compare! For the loose leaf version, personally, I do one teaspoon per 200ml. It'll seem like very little, but the leaves will expand a lot!",5,thecourageofstars,18wtnus,Milk tea,2,6,,"Hi all!

Typically, what I do is brew 10 teabags/gal of my base before adding any honey or yeast, and then after fermentation I steep another 10 tea bags in the mead before bottling. This usually works great for a product that will be drunk within a couple months however I have a jasmine green tea mead which is approaching a year in age, and although it’s a wonderfully tasting, slightly sweet mead, the tea flavor is almost completely gone.

The first is concentrated flavor addition via tincture.

However, I’m not sure how best to make a green tea tincture because I’m not exactly sure what compounds in the tea are more soluble in alcohol as opposed to water.

18wbtdu,kfwrgsm,"Brewed Gong Fu style. 4 g tea to 45ish ml water at 212 F. Gaiwan, cha hai, cup warmed. Tea steamed. 5 seconds, 10 s, 15 s, 20 s, 25 s, 30 s, 35 s, 40 s, 45 s, 50 s, 55 s, 1 minute, 1.5 m, 2 m, 3 m, 5 m, 8 m

Nose was a mix of lemon grass, florality, and vegetal notes to start.
Palate was quite nice with note akin to mix of apples and pears and just a little hint of uncooked vegetables.
Mouthfeel was silky smooth.
Tasty pears on the finish.

Lemon zest entered into the palate on the 5th or 6th infusion.
Mouthfeel was excellent when the tea cooled a bit.
Lemon note dominated nose on 8th infusion. 
A nice astringency also came into the picture at this infusion.

Did first to last comparison. 2nd infusion had much more of that fresh vegetable note and a little briskness. 2nd to last was rounded and sweet without any vegetation notes. 1st was very light and last was mellow but still had that excellent mouthfeel.

This was an excellent tea nearly from start to finish. It was well balanced with a wonderful flavor profile, mouthfeel, good finish, and great longevity. This is exactly the sort of experience I was looking for when joining all these tea subscription clubs. I highly recommend getting this tea if you can (assuming you like a citrus forward flavor profile).

Originally I brewed it in a kettle, well-above the recommended temperature. As a beginner, I still loved it. Eventually I got a Gaiwan and a host cup and started sharing with my friends. My girlfriend doesn't like tea, but when I brew this, she always asks for a couple cups.

I got it from a local tea shop in Seattle called B. Fuller's Mortar & Pestle. My sister was visiting me, so I took her here while I showed her around the Fremont neighborhood. She also wasn't a tea person, but after the owner sampled it for us, she bought herself 3oz and stocks herself up on it every time she visits. I'm not sure if this is the best source of this tea, but I've tried ordering this tea from 2 other sources and they were artificially flavored and tasted awful.

Frankly, I’m pretty new to tea, but I have a background in flavors and fragrances, and the one thing that has astounded me in this subreddit is how tunnel visioned it is on something that is so diverse.

Tea has as much or more diversity as wine. Yet, this community talks about one specific area. It’s the equivalent of r/wine only talking about wines from Bordeaux. 

There are 2 distinct species of tea with a total of 4 sub-species and hundreds of cultivars. Yet, the discussion is pretty much just about yunnan tea which is one of the assamica subspecies. 

The funny thing is that this subspecies is named assamica because it’s from Assam, India, yet there is basically no discussion of Indian tea here.

Correct, I’m not from UK lol. 

I tried it for the first time 3 days ago and now it’s just…it makes sense. The sweetness of the cookie didn’t ruin the tea at all as I imagined. 

If I sweeten tea it’s with raw organic honey. I had some sweet hot tea (green tea + mint, for those who are curious) and had some pretty bland cookies (the ‘grandma cookies’ in the blue tin)….and it really made my day and I feel like I’ve leveled up in some way. 

That is all. ✌️

18wabpx,kfwuejf,"Mix 50:50 milk and water, boil it on the stove with some strong black tea (Darjeeling, English breakfast, that type of thing), and add garam masala. Whole garam masala is best, but if you can’t get that, the important ingredients are cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves, with various optional extras like coriander, cumin, fennel, bay, peppercorns, mace or chiles. Figure out what you like. Probably add some ginger too.

Boil all that for five minutes or so, strain it, and then either refrigerate or drink. You’ll want to add lots of sugar before it starts tasting familiar, but it will.

It also has some caffeine, albeit less than coffee (that's why I switched myself - too much caffeine gives me anxiety and keeps me awake too long).

If she's into lattes, I might recommend getting an Earl Grey (a black tea variant) and learning how to make London Fogs.

To make a good tea you have to  have  good  water/tea ratio (for japanese greans I would genneraly recommend using around 5g/100ml, it's pretty good ratio,  it's quite alot maybe but you can at least give it a try, the infusions will be much more concentrated.),  good temperature of water (not every tea will be suitable for high temperatures, some of teas like gyokuro for example should be brewed even in the temperatures like 45-55°C), and the quality of water (hard tap water will drastically affects the taste. It's good to use some filters for water).

I have really been enjoying some Yunnan silver needles, which do have quite  bit of body, and the silver needle cake from YS.",5,Lizzebed,18vyrch,"Yin Zhen, overhyped or an acquired taste?",3,12,,"I've seen this discussion come up before with regard to premium whites. While Yin Zhens are a more expensive (e.g. premium) grade, a lot of people seem to prefer Bai Mudans or Shou Meis, often citing the fuller body. What do you think?

**Personal experience.** I recently found the motivation to start seriously delving into premium chinese teas, having previously stuck with mostly japanese teas. Whites are not something I've explored much, other than lower grades 10+ years ago and an aged Shou Mei a month or two ago (which I really liked). So I picked up a sample of a pricy 2023 Bai Hao Yin Zhen for reference. I also picked up a 2023 Jun Shan Yin Zhen, since I've really enjoyed even cheaper yellows in the past.

Both were definitely lookers, with really plump and fuzzy buds. I did gong fu brews of both, and really took my time with them. While they are different teas, I noticed some similarities, which I guess are related to the Yin Zhen quality. E.g. a starchy/dusty mouthfeel, a very light body (low astringency), a more complex but subtle (muted) aroma, and a nice buzz.

While they were high quality without a doubt, I struggled to enjoy them. The Bai Hao in particular even made me a bit nauseated, probably because of the lingering, milky sweetness, which reminded me of flavours I don't enjoy (i.e. unripe avocado). I also struggled a bit with the complex aroma, which brought me to violets, raw pumpkin/cucumber, cassia cinnamon, and oats. I found it a bit strange and disharmonious.

The Jun Shan was very subtle, giving me mostly cocoa, but also some notes of hardwood sawdust. With the cheaper yellows I've had, the fuller body really helped to bring out the cocoa and oak (e.g. vanilla) notes, giving me a more chocolatey taste overall. Hence the Jun Shan felt almost lacking (or faulty) to me, even when disregarding the price. But I guess it's just not my cup of tea.

**Conclusion.** So I'm finding myself in the ""I want more body""-camp. I'll probably try brewing hotter and longer with the few grams I have left of each.

I would be happy to hear from any Yin Zhen fans here. What are your experiences? What do you enjoy? Is there a lot of variability? Does age make a very big difference?",GentleMinty,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/18vyrch/yin_zhen_overhyped_or_an_acquired_taste/,0,1

I usually relate body to the consistency of the liquor tho and yinzhen definitely has a consistency of a diluted oatmilk, smooth and creamy, starchy maybe dusty as in rough? definitely not. Flavour wise the yinzhen I had had a strong taste of custard/flan minus the caramel, florals, slightly green and very light nectar notes. 

Yin zhen does not really change much as it ages imo. I tasted light cacao nib notes in a 5 year old yinzhen but the taste kind of remained the same as a new yinzhen, minus the green notes.

Expensive yes but not necessarily overhyped as it also feels luxurious in the mouth to some people. Cant speak for jun shan cause I have never tasted it",3,deathnube,18vyrch,"Yin Zhen, overhyped or an acquired taste?",3,12,,"I've seen this discussion come up before with regard to premium whites. While Yin Zhens are a more expensive (e.g. premium) grade, a lot of people seem to prefer Bai Mudans or Shou Meis, often citing the fuller body. What do you think?

**Personal experience.** I recently found the motivation to start seriously delving into premium chinese teas, having previously stuck with mostly japanese teas. Whites are not something I've explored much, other than lower grades 10+ years ago and an aged Shou Mei a month or two ago (which I really liked). So I picked up a sample of a pricy 2023 Bai Hao Yin Zhen for reference. I also picked up a 2023 Jun Shan Yin Zhen, since I've really enjoyed even cheaper yellows in the past.

Both were definitely lookers, with really plump and fuzzy buds. I did gong fu brews of both, and really took my time with them. While they are different teas, I noticed some similarities, which I guess are related to the Yin Zhen quality. E.g. a starchy/dusty mouthfeel, a very light body (low astringency), a more complex but subtle (muted) aroma, and a nice buzz.

While they were high quality without a doubt, I struggled to enjoy them. The Bai Hao in particular even made me a bit nauseated, probably because of the lingering, milky sweetness, which reminded me of flavours I don't enjoy (i.e. unripe avocado). I also struggled a bit with the complex aroma, which brought me to violets, raw pumpkin/cucumber, cassia cinnamon, and oats. I found it a bit strange and disharmonious.

The Jun Shan was very subtle, giving me mostly cocoa, but also some notes of hardwood sawdust. With the cheaper yellows I've had, the fuller body really helped to bring out the cocoa and oak (e.g. vanilla) notes, giving me a more chocolatey taste overall. Hence the Jun Shan felt almost lacking (or faulty) to me, even when disregarding the price. But I guess it's just not my cup of tea.

**Conclusion.** So I'm finding myself in the ""I want more body""-camp. I'll probably try brewing hotter and longer with the few grams I have left of each.

I turn it on low every hour or two to make sure it hits ~180°F at least every four hours. I keep it lidded all day. These steps seem to prevent it from going stale and tannin-y. I'm also using good loose leaf green tea. I do this so I can always have tea readily available when my throat is sore. The few minutes of making a fresh batch each time always feel so long and awful, especially the seventh time I've done it in a day.

Every person I've told this to thinks I'm out of my goddamn mind, but I don't get it. It works. You *can* fuck up tea this way but I haven't done that in years.

One final note: if you're going to explore these various types of tea, I'd also recommend getting a gaiwan and looking up how to do gong-fu brewing. It's different from ""western style"" brewing: Western style brewing uses a high water to leaf ratio and then steeps for (relatively) long periods of time. Gong fu brewing uses a much lower water to leaf ratio with short steeps. Western brewing works well for certain teas--e.g., black teas that you intend to add milk and sugar to.

18vj6wm,kfrf4xi,"Brewed Gong Fu style. 3 g tea to 45ish ml water at 212 F. Gaiwan, cha hai, cup warmed. Tea steamed. 5 seconds, 10 s, 15 s, 20 s, 25 s, 30 s, 35 s, 45 s, 1 minute, 2 m, 5 m, 10 m

Camphor dominated the nose with a little humidity note.
Palate was light with camphor and sweetness. A little bit of huigan.
Finish started off light.
Good silky mouthfeel.

This was another “toothpaste” tea. Not my favorite flavor profile, but it is fun.

Nose was still camphor and wet woods on 10th infusion.
Light sweetness crept into finish as session went on.

Compared 2nd infusion with next to last. 2nd didn’t have much nose, but had a little bitterness to the palate. 2nd to last was more mellow and rounded.
1st infusion almost tasted like Scotch. Last was very light, thick and mellow, demonstrating the leaves had little left to give.

I really should have done a side by sids with this tea and the 2010 Liu Bao EOT provided in this month’s club shipment to see if it demonstrated the effects of aging for that long. Maybe some other time.

I personally wouldn’t seek more of this tea, just because of the flavor profile, but it is fun and enjoyable for what it is.",7,DevOpsProDude,18vj6wm,2023-12-31 The Essence of Tea 1990 Loose Leaf Liu Bao,25,5,,See comment for notes (enjoyable session with old aged toothpaste flavor profile).,DevOpsProDude,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18vj6wm,1,1

My strategy for this review is to drink 3 cups of each tea back to back and then write my thoughts at the same time. You’ll have to bear with me just as my stomach will have to bear all this liquid caffeine for breakfast. 

I’ll start by saying I was asked to write another review for iteaworld, and I politely declined the offer because my life is too busy right now. The package of oolong showed up anyways, and I guess I am a sucker because here I am writing a review. I am glad they disregarded my wishes because they truly brought the heat on this sampler. It also gave me something to do on what is my least favorite holiday of the year by far. 

In my opinion the biggest thing holding back these samplers was the 3g bag weight. It was just a little too low to have a proper gong fu sessions, and it’d be weird to western brew these teas. This most recent sampler is a generous 5 grams and it is a perfect sample size now. I generally put around 7-8 grams in my 120 ml pot but that’s because I have way too much tea sitting around. 

So let’s jump right into the review. I’ll put myself on the record by saying I am not the world’s biggest oolong lover. I do lean more towards greener oolongs though. I have also written 3 reviews on this company so if you want some info on who they are and what they are trying to do, i’ll link that in my comment section. 

Tieguayin

Up first is the oolong that everyone knows and loves, Tieguanyin. This is a one bud and two leaves picking from Spring 2023. Someone commented on my post saying they were impressed I can read fluently speak Chinese. This is obviously true and I will say that Tieguanyin translates to merciful tin can man. You can trust me, don’t google it. 

The nose on this tea comes across grassy and floral. There is some nuttiness and lavender as well. As always I get some cooked green notes like kale and roasted brussel sprouts. This has a more complex aroma than other TGY I have tried. 

I am ripping all of these teas at full boil, which typically isn’t what i’d do for green oolongs. Contrary to popular belief though, you can go full boil on all Chinese teas if you want. I let the first steeps run long so I can pull out a lot of flavor to make reviewing it easier. The first steep has a lot of steamed greens flavor. Once again, a surprising amount of complexity in it. Hint of sweetness. On the later steeps it mellows out to a more typical TGY flavor profile. Buttery sweetness and a creamy mouthfeel. Zero umami notes in this tea, which is something I usually find in green oolongs. I actually find this to be exceptionally good, and it really outclasses some other TGY on complexity. 

Zhangping Shui Xan

I am already looking forward to trying this oolong because I have never had a pressed oolong. The little hints of purple on the leaves excites me too. This is also one bud with two leaves from Spring 2023. An amusing side note is that their website says “slightly firework aroma” as a descriptor for this tea.

The aroma of this tea is absolutely phenomenal. Hands down it is the best smelling oolong I have experienced. It is an absolute nut bomb or roast toasty goodness. Apple pie and praline pecans. 

The taste completely turned 180 into a strong berry fruitiness. Some nuttiness lingers but now it is onto apples and frozen berries. A hint of astringency just enough to let you know it’s there. This tea is truly special, and I think this is an oolong that is made for puer lovers. It’s strong but balanced. This is probably my second favorite oolong of all time. 

6 cups of tea down and my body is letting me know that it hates me. I won’t listen though and power on through. 

Da Hong Pao

This is probably the second most well known oolong out of china. 99% of posts from people trying to identify their tea gifts and Tieguanyin or Da Hong Pao. I’ll set my expectations accordingly because I am not the biggest fan of Da Hong Pao. This is a one bud with two leaves from Spring 2023 (they are all the same so I should’ve just said that up front). 

Some great savory smokiness in the aroma. Smoked meats and dark chocolate cherries. Some jellied fruits is back in this one which has been a constant of the silver teapot that I have been trying to avoid. 

As I expected the flavor on it is not as nice as the aroma. I’m getting dark fruit and some malt. Pleasant astringency but it’s just a little one note overall. It’s good but I didn’t really expect to love this one and that held true. I’m not a professional though so maybe I just suck at brewing DHP, so you can tell me I am an idiot in the comments. 

Fenghuang Dancong

This is allegedly from 100+ year old trees. I have some opinions on that but I am not going to get into that in this post. I’m not 100 years old though so who knows. 

As expected the aroma of this is powerfully floral and full of honey. At this point after a lot of tea is usually where my brain stops working so well. I also burnt the shit out of tongue on this brew. I’ll say something really specific about the aroma, and it’s that it reminds me of subway flatbread. 

Regardless, I found this tea to be better than the DHP. Super berry forward flavor with a nice roasted balance to round it out.

When I first heard about iteaworld, I expected them to have lower quality offerings than what I currently drink. This is 100% not the case though, as they truly bring a really solid product to the market. I’ll briefly mention their focus on sustainability and information about the teas that makes this a great place for beginners. 

I’ll happily give this sampler my stamp of approval and it would make a great gift to someone trying to get into Chinese teas. It also comes with tea bags made out of corn starch I believe for those without a gong fu setup. I’ll probably end up cold brewing this sampler as well because I love an iced oolong. 

I hope 2024 is a great year for everyone and that we can leave behind the bad stuff in 2023.

18vd6yy,kfrqy5g,"I bought the ""Classic Tea Selection"" sampler on Black Friday and was pretty underwhelmed. This was with the 3.5g packets fwiw. I found each tea to be light on flavor but it looks like you have a few that didn't come with my sampler. 

I did a side-by-side comparison with for DHPs from different vendors and theirs came last. Teasenz took the lead on that tasting, which was a surprise after several of their other offerings had disappointed me.

Their Lapsang Souchang had a nice complexity but very light flavor and barely noticeable smokiness. 

The Yunnan black wasn't bad, a decent benchmark. The bag wasn't sealed, which I suspect may have muted the flavor. Normally I take tea straight, but I found this to be quite nice with a bit of coconut sugar. For the price I'm not disappointed.

I'm not big on TGY but again, felt it was lacking.

I haven't tried the Fenghuang Dancong, Yingde black, Minnan narcissus, or the Enshi Jade Dew (free sample) yet. 

I had high hopes and really wanted to like this company because I'm a sucker for sustainable practices, which they seem to support. The packaging is nice (other than the one unsealed bag). Part of my order was not packed with the shipment but support was quick, understanding, easy, and made good on sending what had been forgotten. I'm hoping the teas I've not yet tried will change my view. It seems like a good company overall, I'm just disappointed in the product. This can be changed and considering their switch in sample package sizes, it seems they take criticism well and are willing to make improvements. I'm open to giving them another shot in the future, but for now I'll continue working my way through the suggested vendors list.",2,Idyotec,18vd6yy,"iTeaworld brings the heat, they fixed their main issue, and my rambling review of it",36,11,,"I am back with another iteaworld review on this lovely New Year’s Eve. My strategy for this review is to drink 3 cups of each tea back to back and then write my thoughts at the same time. You’ll have to bear with me just as my stomach will have to bear all this liquid caffeine for breakfast. 

I’ll start by saying I was asked to write another review for iteaworld, and I politely declined the offer because my life is too busy right now. The package of oolong showed up anyways, and I guess I am a sucker because here I am writing a review. I am glad they disregarded my wishes because they truly brought the heat on this sampler. It also gave me something to do on what is my least favorite holiday of the year by far. 

In my opinion the biggest thing holding back these samplers was the 3g bag weight. It was just a little too low to have a proper gong fu sessions, and it’d be weird to western brew these teas. This most recent sampler is a generous 5 grams and it is a perfect sample size now. I generally put around 7-8 grams in my 120 ml pot but that’s because I have way too much tea sitting around. 

So let’s jump right into the review. I’ll put myself on the record by saying I am not the world’s biggest oolong lover. I do lean more towards greener oolongs though. I have also written 3 reviews on this company so if you want some info on who they are and what they are trying to do, i’ll link that in my comment section. 

Tieguayin

Up first is the oolong that everyone knows and loves, Tieguanyin. This is a one bud and two leaves picking from Spring 2023. Someone commented on my post saying they were impressed I can read fluently speak Chinese. This is obviously true and I will say that Tieguanyin translates to merciful tin can man. You can trust me, don’t google it. 

The nose on this tea comes across grassy and floral. There is some nuttiness and lavender as well. As always I get some cooked green notes like kale and roasted brussel sprouts. This has a more complex aroma than other TGY I have tried. 

I am ripping all of these teas at full boil, which typically isn’t what i’d do for green oolongs. Contrary to popular belief though, you can go full boil on all Chinese teas if you want. I let the first steeps run long so I can pull out a lot of flavor to make reviewing it easier. The first steep has a lot of steamed greens flavor. Once again, a surprising amount of complexity in it. Hint of sweetness. On the later steeps it mellows out to a more typical TGY flavor profile. Buttery sweetness and a creamy mouthfeel. Zero umami notes in this tea, which is something I usually find in green oolongs. I actually find this to be exceptionally good, and it really outclasses some other TGY on complexity. 

Zhangping Shui Xan

I am already looking forward to trying this oolong because I have never had a pressed oolong. The little hints of purple on the leaves excites me too. This is also one bud with two leaves from Spring 2023. An amusing side note is that their website says “slightly firework aroma” as a descriptor for this tea.

The aroma of this tea is absolutely phenomenal. Hands down it is the best smelling oolong I have experienced. It is an absolute nut bomb or roast toasty goodness. Apple pie and praline pecans. 

The taste completely turned 180 into a strong berry fruitiness. Some nuttiness lingers but now it is onto apples and frozen berries. A hint of astringency just enough to let you know it’s there. This tea is truly special, and I think this is an oolong that is made for puer lovers. It’s strong but balanced. This is probably my second favorite oolong of all time. 

6 cups of tea down and my body is letting me know that it hates me. I won’t listen though and power on through. 

Da Hong Pao

This is probably the second most well known oolong out of china. 99% of posts from people trying to identify their tea gifts and Tieguanyin or Da Hong Pao. I’ll set my expectations accordingly because I am not the biggest fan of Da Hong Pao. This is a one bud with two leaves from Spring 2023 (they are all the same so I should’ve just said that up front). 

Some great savory smokiness in the aroma. Smoked meats and dark chocolate cherries. Some jellied fruits is back in this one which has been a constant of the silver teapot that I have been trying to avoid. 

As I expected the flavor on it is not as nice as the aroma. I’m getting dark fruit and some malt. Pleasant astringency but it’s just a little one note overall. It’s good but I didn’t really expect to love this one and that held true. I’m not a professional though so maybe I just suck at brewing DHP, so you can tell me I am an idiot in the comments. 

Fenghuang Dancong

This is allegedly from 100+ year old trees. I have some opinions on that but I am not going to get into that in this post. I’m not 100 years old though so who knows. 

As expected the aroma of this is powerfully floral and full of honey. At this point after a lot of tea is usually where my brain stops working so well. I also burnt the shit out of tongue on this brew. I’ll say something really specific about the aroma, and it’s that it reminds me of subway flatbread. 

Regardless, I found this tea to be better than the DHP. Super berry forward flavor with a nice roasted balance to round it out.

When I first heard about iteaworld, I expected them to have lower quality offerings than what I currently drink. This is 100% not the case though, as they truly bring a really solid product to the market. I’ll briefly mention their focus on sustainability and information about the teas that makes this a great place for beginners. 

I’ll happily give this sampler my stamp of approval and it would make a great gift to someone trying to get into Chinese teas. It also comes with tea bags made out of corn starch I believe for those without a gong fu setup. I’ll probably end up cold brewing this sampler as well because I love an iced oolong. 

I hope 2024 is a great year for everyone and that we can leave behind the bad stuff in 2023.

18vd6yy,kfs5kpv,Nice review! Can you help me understand what you mean by frozen berries as a flavor note?

Regardless, I found this tea to be better than the DHP. Super berry forward flavor with a nice roasted balance to round it out.

When I first heard about iteaworld, I expected them to have lower quality offerings than what I currently drink. This is 100% not the case though, as they truly bring a really solid product to the market. I’ll briefly mention their focus on sustainability and information about the teas that makes this a great place for beginners. 

I’ll happily give this sampler my stamp of approval and it would make a great gift to someone trying to get into Chinese teas. It also comes with tea bags made out of corn starch I believe for those without a gong fu setup. I’ll probably end up cold brewing this sampler as well because I love an iced oolong. 

I hope 2024 is a great year for everyone and that we can leave behind the bad stuff in 2023.

18vd6yy,kfs6i2l,I think I get that. Maybe a bit tinny? Thanks,1,regolith1111,18vd6yy,"iTeaworld brings the heat, they fixed their main issue, and my rambling review of it",36,11,,"I am back with another iteaworld review on this lovely New Year’s Eve. My strategy for this review is to drink 3 cups of each tea back to back and then write my thoughts at the same time. You’ll have to bear with me just as my stomach will have to bear all this liquid caffeine for breakfast. 

I’ll start by saying I was asked to write another review for iteaworld, and I politely declined the offer because my life is too busy right now. The package of oolong showed up anyways, and I guess I am a sucker because here I am writing a review. I am glad they disregarded my wishes because they truly brought the heat on this sampler. It also gave me something to do on what is my least favorite holiday of the year by far. 

In my opinion the biggest thing holding back these samplers was the 3g bag weight. It was just a little too low to have a proper gong fu sessions, and it’d be weird to western brew these teas. This most recent sampler is a generous 5 grams and it is a perfect sample size now. I generally put around 7-8 grams in my 120 ml pot but that’s because I have way too much tea sitting around. 

So let’s jump right into the review. I’ll put myself on the record by saying I am not the world’s biggest oolong lover. I do lean more towards greener oolongs though. I have also written 3 reviews on this company so if you want some info on who they are and what they are trying to do, i’ll link that in my comment section. 

Tieguayin

Up first is the oolong that everyone knows and loves, Tieguanyin. This is a one bud and two leaves picking from Spring 2023. Someone commented on my post saying they were impressed I can read fluently speak Chinese. This is obviously true and I will say that Tieguanyin translates to merciful tin can man. You can trust me, don’t google it. 

The nose on this tea comes across grassy and floral. There is some nuttiness and lavender as well. As always I get some cooked green notes like kale and roasted brussel sprouts. This has a more complex aroma than other TGY I have tried. 

I am ripping all of these teas at full boil, which typically isn’t what i’d do for green oolongs. Contrary to popular belief though, you can go full boil on all Chinese teas if you want. I let the first steeps run long so I can pull out a lot of flavor to make reviewing it easier. The first steep has a lot of steamed greens flavor. Once again, a surprising amount of complexity in it. Hint of sweetness. On the later steeps it mellows out to a more typical TGY flavor profile. Buttery sweetness and a creamy mouthfeel. Zero umami notes in this tea, which is something I usually find in green oolongs. I actually find this to be exceptionally good, and it really outclasses some other TGY on complexity. 

Zhangping Shui Xan

I am already looking forward to trying this oolong because I have never had a pressed oolong. The little hints of purple on the leaves excites me too. This is also one bud with two leaves from Spring 2023. An amusing side note is that their website says “slightly firework aroma” as a descriptor for this tea.

The aroma of this tea is absolutely phenomenal. Hands down it is the best smelling oolong I have experienced. It is an absolute nut bomb or roast toasty goodness. Apple pie and praline pecans. 

The taste completely turned 180 into a strong berry fruitiness. Some nuttiness lingers but now it is onto apples and frozen berries. A hint of astringency just enough to let you know it’s there. This tea is truly special, and I think this is an oolong that is made for puer lovers. It’s strong but balanced. This is probably my second favorite oolong of all time. 

6 cups of tea down and my body is letting me know that it hates me. I won’t listen though and power on through. 

Da Hong Pao

This is probably the second most well known oolong out of china. 99% of posts from people trying to identify their tea gifts and Tieguanyin or Da Hong Pao. I’ll set my expectations accordingly because I am not the biggest fan of Da Hong Pao. This is a one bud with two leaves from Spring 2023 (they are all the same so I should’ve just said that up front). 

Some great savory smokiness in the aroma. Smoked meats and dark chocolate cherries. Some jellied fruits is back in this one which has been a constant of the silver teapot that I have been trying to avoid. 

As I expected the flavor on it is not as nice as the aroma. I’m getting dark fruit and some malt. Pleasant astringency but it’s just a little one note overall. It’s good but I didn’t really expect to love this one and that held true. I’m not a professional though so maybe I just suck at brewing DHP, so you can tell me I am an idiot in the comments. 

Fenghuang Dancong

This is allegedly from 100+ year old trees. I have some opinions on that but I am not going to get into that in this post. I’m not 100 years old though so who knows. 

As expected the aroma of this is powerfully floral and full of honey. At this point after a lot of tea is usually where my brain stops working so well. I also burnt the shit out of tongue on this brew. I’ll say something really specific about the aroma, and it’s that it reminds me of subway flatbread.

18uwacf,kfn229n,"Yesterday we were out in Anhua County’s Dafu Township visiting a dark tea workshop. As we were brewing up the gazillonth cup of bricked dark tea, I asked the owner what kind of dark tea they grew up drinking. To my surprise, she said that no one here locally actually drank much dark tea at home until very recently, despite hundreds of years of dark tea production. Instead, they drink a very light green tea that breaks all the rules. 
  

  
After dinner, we got to meet this tea. It is made by taking raw tea leafs, flash boiling them, hand kneading them while still hot, and then either drying them under the sun or over a gentle fire of ""maple"" seedpods (see picture two). That’s it. As you might expect, drying it over a fire makes the final product kinda  smoky, but both methods make an incredibly light tea. This lightness is compensated by its unique brewing style, in a bowl with sesame, peanuts, or toasted rice. With each sip, one needs to blow down on the bowl and kick up the tea leaves and other ingredients up to the surface so some can be sucked down with the broth. When tea time is over, everyone’s bowls are empty. Chewing on the tender tea leaves certainly gives the kick that the broth lacks.
  

  
Unlike many other places we have visited and lived in, most tea growers and pickers in Anhua have been totally disconnected from the final product. The factories and their highly specialized workers make dark tea for consumption thousands of milers. This was true 100 years ago and it is largely true today. The tea pictured above, 农家茶 (farmer house tea), was what the growers picked for themselves in the weeks between the first flush and Guyu.",282,OneRiverTea,18uwacf,"In Anhua, tea farmers drink this, not dark tea.",403,26,,,OneRiverTea,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18uwacf,1,1

I just realized that I have 2 hairline cracks in my brand new Kyusu. Is that something that's normal and not a problem, or is that a reason to get a replacement?

The cracks are only on the inside, very fine, and only visible in good lighting (sunlight or lamp). You can also feel the cracks.

The big one on the side is visible in the pictures, the other one is right in the center, not visible in the pictures.

Edit: Interestingly, the center and the spot with the visible crack dry instantly, while the rest of the pot stays wet much longer.

18v3ch1,kfqfy8u,"1. How old it could be: The stamp  on the bottom was common for Kutani ware made in the 1960s which checks out with saying your grandpa bought it around 70 years ago. 

2. Where it’s from: This is actually Japanese, Kutani ware is made in southern Ishikawa in cities such as Kanazawa. 

3. What types of tea it’s for: As you may know in Japan they mostly consume green tea, although this is a porcelain kyusu so you can brew any tea in it. Some materials such as tokoname clay may take up flavors more readily and can be “seasoned”, but porcelain will not do so. 

4. What it’s made of: Porcelain

5. Lid and bulge: I believe the bulge you’re referring to on the teapot is the handle? If not let me know and maybe I can give you a a better answer. This is a yokode kyusu which means side handle teapot (any Japanese teapot is a kyusu if you’re curious, it’s just a general word and doesn’t necessarily mean it has to have a side handle, although you’ll see a lot of people referring to any side handle teapot as a kyusu). The side handle is hollow to disperse heat so that you can hold it without burning your hand. The teacup likely has a lid just to keep your tea warm.

18v3ch1,kfqv625,"Hello. Like the other reddit or mentioned, this this a Kutani ware Japanese teapot (kyusu). The side handle configuration is based on Chinese herbal/medicinal boiling pots.

Your pot has a nice crackling celadon glaze and might even be handle painted, but the overall shape/fitting is slightly rough so I think it's a workshop production. I don't know kutani very well so can't tell you which kiln.

In mint condition thus might fetch maybe $100 to 150 as a set?

Vintage Japanese tea vessels aren't usually worth much unless they are guinomi/chawan or tokoname pots made by famous artists.

You can probably make some green tea or hong tea out of this. This set does not seem gongfu appropriate.

18uyd49,kfnxd1l,"No one has addressed the main difference between these two brewing styles. 

Gong fu brewing is a high leaf to water ratio. Sometimes I will be at 8 grams of tea for 120ml of water. Because of this you are doing super short steeps but drinking many steeps. Sometime you can even get to 8-10 steeps. This is just because you have so much leaf you do not need to steep it for long or it will be better and overpowered. Once I get to the last 8-10 steeps though I will be well into the minutes long steep range. 

Western style brewing is low leaf to water ratio. Maybe 3 grams per 600ml of water. Because you need to get flavor into that quantity of water you are going to be steeping much longer. 

Both ways are fine, but I have my preference for sure. Some teas are suited better to each. Western style teas or flavored teas are going to be western style brewing. I don’t know many people who gong fu brew with earl grey. Chinese, japanese, and taiwanese are suited to gong fu or grandpa style.

18uyd49,kfno5n6,"Amount of leaves, amount of water, water temperature, time of steeping

You can play around with these factors when making tea. For example, if you use a huge amount of water, you will need to increase the amount of tea or the time steeping. That’s why western style brewing in a big teapot requires several minutes, while Asian-style brewing uses a smaller vessel with lower brewing time. Using a lower temperature water will also let you brew longer without making the tea as bitter.",7,dadotea,18uyd49,6-Second Steeping?,13,11,,"I went to a tea house today, and the person serving the tea steeped the black/red tea for six seconds.

18uddkt,kfk7jv0,"Fantastic write up, sounds like a real treat. I typically favor the more oxidized oolongs but this one sounds delectable!",1,lemonpjb,18uddkt,Some very gao gaoshan tasting,43,2,,"Was able to score some winter 22/23 goashan oolong of the Qinxing varietal that was grown at 2650 metres. This tea was expertly prepared by tea roaster Lee Ming Fan, and is a fair bit more expensive than other oolongs from this area (Hua Gung / Water Source Peak).

Dry leaf smell was peppery, woody and almost saltbush-like. 

I start the gongfu session with a 45 second opening steep with 95 degree water, to open up the tea balls. 

The wet leaf smell is almost meat broth like. Savoury, somewhat spiced, vegetable and very enticing. 

Notes of savoury vegetables, mildly astringent fruits and underlay of spiced woods. Lots of activity in the mouth and in the throat. The tea is thick and almost creamy in texture. 

The mountain rhythm is exceptional. As good as the very best DYL I've had years ago when 2600 metre DYL was still reasonably available. 

There is an interesting cold slate note. The locals call it ""cold rhythm"". 

The chi is incredible. Tingling in the cheeks, scalp and back of neck. Keep in mind that I'm well accustomed to tea and can drink up to 4 gongfu sessions a day, so for me to feel significant chi is unusual. This is the very first time that a tea has also caused my arm (triceps) to tingle. 

Longevity is Incredible for a green oolong, and I continue to extract very good soup even beyond the 6th steep. 

Overall this tea is incredible, one of the very best I've had this year. The mountain rhythm and cold rhythm makes this a rarerified experience. It's reignited my interest in finding more high quality goashan. I'll be exploring a few more Lishan plantations and tea makers next year!",OudSmoothie,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18uddkt,1,1

I like adding a little flavor to my teas and first started with mango honey and it has progressed from there.  

I’m currently experimenting with flavored teas but the problem is full strength can be a bit overwhelming in the flavor department.

So what I’ve been doing is mixing the flavored @ %20 and the remaining #80 is usually made up of Sencha and Dragon well/longjing.

Since I am mixing I not sure if it’s worth spending good money on high end teas just to be masked by a flavored tea, or is it?

18uja1m,kfpkb9l,">it’s not unusual for a year’s spring harvest to become available only by autumn

It is not unusual in the EU. In Asia, it is.

>I believe the leaves are allowed to rest a few months before processing/sale

That is true for Tencha only (Matcha). Other first harvest tea should be available almost immediately, like Shincha as you mentioned.

>This is probably delayed further for organic teas, as each new harvest might need to be newly certified before sale

There is an annual check, but they do issue certificate for the farm, not to the batch. As EU has an agreement with Japan, required certificate grants the right to sell a product as organic. Can't imagine a longer period of few weeks or a month to process the paperwork on a shipment, but definitely not 4-5 months. The only reason I can imagine is a miscalculated stock management.

Otherwise, it is a great source for teas and teawares in the EU.",2,tomknx,18uja1m,Online Shops for Japanese Teas,1,11,,Does anyone have some recommendations for online shops selling (decent quality) japanese teas at a reasonable price (including shipping costs into the EU)?,SunAiD98,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/18uja1m/online_shops_for_japanese_teas/,0,1

As for the rest of Japanese tea, I do know that Japan does have stricter laws and regulations regarding pesticide usage than say China for example, but pesticides are still frequently used. 

Japan tangent aside, most established tea sites will flat out say if it's pesticide free since it's a great selling point. The only thing op really has to look out for is how many pesticides have been tested for. A tea can be ""pesticide free"" but only have been tested for 40 as opposed to 200 or 400.

18u0g1w,kfjqalb,"Well, that very much depends on what your budget is. :) There are plenty of serious suppliers that you can trust to sell you what they say they are selling you. It also depends on what construction technique has been used to make the tea pot. You will be paying a lot more for a fully handmade pot than for one where they used machinery to make some parts. I’ve got one of the latter and am quite happy with it, as it looks lovely, brews and pours well, and affects the tea just the same.

 If you’ve got a glazed teapot or gaiwan already, you can use that for all types of tea. Unglazed clay pots do affect the tea, but they don’t work well for all types of tea.  Different clays have different effects on the tea,  so depending on what teas you prefer, yixing might not be the best option for you.

I’ve also got some unglazed yixing clay cups and they affect the flavour of the tea too (and they were a lot cheaper!). It’s been interesting to experiment with different teas and see which ones turn out best in gaiwan + unglazed cups vs yixing pot & cups  vs yixing pot + porcelain cups.

If you want to buy a yixing clay pot, of course you should go ahead and do that, but if you haven’t already, just spend some money on really nice teas and an inexpensive porcelain gaiwan first.

It gets stained with tea, in that partial circle, above where the heating elements are. Then slowly, the whole thing starts to get stained, especially the basket.

Do not scrub with anything abrasive. The glass will scratch and so will the stainless steel. The scratches will get stained faster.

That kettle was very expensive, but is used daily, often several times a day, and has lasted perfectly for 7 years of abuse.

online: tealyra and adagio both sell loose and bagged tea. ahmad is popular in some areas, I’ve only tried their cardamom tea. harney and sons sells loose and bagged, I would stick to their flavoured teas (if you like cinnamon, I recommend the hot cinnamon spice). 

grocery store: bigelow( especially constant comment) is a generally well liked american tea company that’s sold in grocery stores. Tazo can also be founded pretty easily and a lot of people seem to like their chai concentrate, though I’m more partial to “oregon chai” brand, which is harder to find. Republic of tea used to be fairly popular. 

general local: check and see if there are any international markets near you, as they tend to stock more tea than grocery stores. check out farmer’s markets as some have people selling tea. I would also try a basic online search for “tea vendor near me,” as you may be able to find small shops with no online presence that way, depending on your locality.

13krspd,jkm11cr,"Unfortunately caffeine is one of the main compounds that make up the flavor of the tea. So no matter what you find I don't think it's ever going to taste quite the same. 

I can speak on your particular tolerance for caffeine, but if it were me I think I'd try just shrinking my portion. Get a small gaiwan that's less than 100ml and brew small shots with less leaf.

EDIT: Sorry, after re-reading your post I get the impression you're using teabags probably because you mention Lipton. In this case you could try shorter brew times and/or cooler water and maybe decrease the water volume to make up for the loss of flavor. It's still going to taste different.",1,Chameleon_Sinensis,13krspd,Decaffeinated black tea brands that don't suck?

118bipf,j9g5f64,"This is typically what people experience, a more sustained energy with less spike and crash.

118bipf,j9gfw7v,"tea has a lower caffeine content than coffee which is probably part of it, but yeah I find even in large amounts it doesn't cause the anxiety that coffee can.

You might also enjoy yerba mate - not strictly tea as it's a totally different plant, but similar in some ways to green tea and (often but not always) smoked. It has a caffeine content somewhere higher than tea and lower than coffee, but again does not cause the jittery anxiety that coffee tends to.

118bipf,j9govmj,It's definitely different. I start my day with tea then usually have a coffee at work. I have ADD so caffeine in general hits a bit different but I can still tell the difference between the two. I think for most people tea provides a more focused and mellow increase in energy while coffee gives me classic spike.leg tapping energy. If used to coffee you might feel like tea isn't doing the job but if you take time to adjust I think it's better overall in the energy it provides.,1,GullyGardener,118bipf,"For those who switched from coffee to tea, what does energy from tea feel like vs coffee?",52,54,,"I abruptly had to switch from coffee to mostly green teas for a health reason and the feeling I get from tea is absolutely different than from coffee.
