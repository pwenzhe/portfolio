    "This notebook is exploratory and has covered a few community detection methods implemented across different libraries. The methods explored here are divisive methods that removes edges and clusters of more densely connected nodes are formed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of community detection in this network is to identify potential groupings of people and organisations with similar interests, given a network that is disjoint and often times not dense as connections between organisations might be limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual inspection is done on some communities determined by each method. Of which, the Ego-Splitting Framework, which also uses the Louvain method as its initial steps, appears favourable for this project's problem statement as it provides a good balance between forming communities with related organisations without stretching the community into too many degrees. Curiously, it did not identify any node which belonged in more than one community, despite the method allowing for overlapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further evaluation using modularity across the network communities showed that the Parallel Louvain and Ego-Splitting network had the highest modularity, which could indicate that the community formed by this method has better quality for this network. Both Ego-Splitting and Parallel Louvain method had much higher modularity than the original graph. This means that the communities produced have better connectivity within the community than across communities. Divide and Conquer had even lower modularity than the baseline, which is further supported by the fact that it had the most communities formed by a large margin and visually appeared to cut the network too aggressively into small partitions. Density may also have been a less valuable metric for this network as the original graph already started with low density, and density across all three methods explored did not differ significantly."
